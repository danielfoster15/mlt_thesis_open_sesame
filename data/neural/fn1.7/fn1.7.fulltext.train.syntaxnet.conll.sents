It has been forwarded in Dēvanāgarī characters with an interlinear translation , but without any transliteration .
The transliteration does not , however , agree with the Dēvanāgarī text , and it has turned out to be so full of mistakes that it has been of no use whatever .
The notes on Gadabā grammar which follow are entirely based on the Bastar specimens .
Semi-consonants are perhaps used in words such as ḍā~ , Santālī dāk ’ , water ; gōy , Santālī gâch ’ , die ; gōgō and gōgōb , to tend , and so forth .
Vowels are often interchanged .
The n of the genitive suffix nū has apparently been replaced by l in lāy-lū , whose ?
Nouns .
If we can trust the specimens , there are no traces of a difference between animate and inanimate nouns , or of the existence of a dual .
The plural appears to be expressed by adding some word meaning ‘ many ’ ; thus , lōṅgā āpōṅg , many fathers , fathers .
A suffix nēn or nan occurs in forms such as sākhī-nēn , the witnesses ; kumbaī-nan , women .
The cases of the direct and indirect object are not expressed in the verb .
The suffix of the genitive is nō , nū , or nā ; thus , āpāṅg-nō , of a father ; kalār-nē-nū , of the liquor seller .
In pīlē kirtā-r khōgīr , the white horse ’ s saddle , we have perhaps a genitive suffix r .Other postpositions are kuruṅg , from ; bō , in , to , etc.
Numerals .
The first numerals will be found in the list of words .
It will be seen that Aryan loan-words are used in Bastar for the numerals seven and following .
The Gadabā numerals are most closely related to those in use in Savara and Khaṛiā .
Pronouns .
The following are the personal pronouns : The form pē-nug , our , in the list of words is probably a mistake .
A form lē , we , seems to occur as a verbal suffix .
Datives and accusatives are apparently formed by prefixing u or ō ; thus , ō-nīṅg , to me ; u-māy , him ; ō-māy , to him ; ōn ō-maī sunō , the son said to him .
Demonstrative pronouns are tē , this ; tō , tu , and nāi , that .
Interrogative pronouns are lai , who ?
Indefinite pronouns are formed from the interrogatives ; thus , laikī , anybody ; maṅgsā and māṅg-ḍig , anything .
Verbs .
The inflexion of verbs is apparently very simple .
Reduplicated and doubled bases are apparently freely used ; thus , sa-saḍagū , attached ; buk-buk , striking , etc.
The direct and the indirect objects do not appear to be expressed in the verb .
The subject is not expressed by means of pronominal suffixes .
traces of a state of affairs which is related to that prevailing in typical Muṇḍā languages .
The above passage which I have been able to restore with some certainty from the very corrupt original , contains the suffixed pronouns nīṅg ( or īṅg ) , I ; pēn , you ; lē , we , used to express the subject .
The common suffix of the present tense is tō or tu ; thus , māṅg-tō , I know ; ḍu-tu , is ; buk-tu , beats ; gō-gōy-ḍu-tu , I am dying .
In māhāparū-nu hukum ār mānī-tōniṅg , God ’ s order not obey-I ; sun-tunī , I will say , and so forth , the tense suffix is perhaps likewise tun , tōn , and the final iṅg or ī must then be the old form of the personal pronoun of the first person singular .
In sun-tōn-ēn , they say , the final ēn is perhaps the suffix of the third person .
Another suffix of the present is nīṅg ; thus , ōinīṅg , go .
The suffix ēḍ in ḍēm-ēḍ-nīṅg ḍutō , doing-I am , seems to correspond to Santālī et ’ .
According to the list of words a suffix bē is added ; thus , buk-tū-bē , I shall strike .
Other future forms are pi-lam , it will come ; nāi-lōṅg , I will go .
The past is formed by adding one of the suffixes u or o , and ī ; thus , ḍu-g-u , was ; sun-ō , said ; ju-ō , saw ; gōi-g-ī , died ; ōig-ī , went ; ōn-ī , heard .
Forms such as buōnēn , killed ; suōnēn , threw , etc., probably contain a pronominal suffix of the third person .
Compound past tenses are formed by adding the verb substantive ; thus , buō-ḍutu , I have killed ; sēbō ḍugu , I had killed ; nīṅg-nu ōḍu-ōn gōē-gu ḍugu mīyō bur-lagu ; bīsugu ḍugu mīō bōgu , my son dead was and revived ; lost was and was found .
I cannot analyse the suffixes in sōbōnō , boughtest , and sōbōnam , I bought .
The common suffix of the imperative is nēn ; thus , tōl-nēn , bind , ju-nēn , see .
Other imperatives are ō-māy nān-bē , to-him give ; luḍōrīng , take ; inḍē , give me ; ā dēmō , do not ; nīṅg samō-su sārdā ḍēmō , let us eating merry make .
The re-duplicated and the present bases are used as verbal nouns .
A suffix g is apparently added in some cases ; thus , māy tu-nū pī-pīg-nu bēlā , he there coming-of time , when he returned ; bun-ḍēg-nu mēnḍēg-nu kōlār ōni , music-of dancing-of sound heard .
The various bases are also used as participles ; thus , buk-buk , beating ; gō-gōb , grazing ; buō , struck , having struck .
Conjunctive participles are formed by adding su ; thus , āāē lē-lē kōpaṭ ēto-su ō-māy bōḍī , all good-good cloth bringing to-him give ; māy mōḍgu-su māy-nu āpuṅg-lai , he having arisen his father-to ( went ) ; mai juō-su māyē ḍēmo , he having-seen pity made .
The negative particle is a prefixed ār or urā ; compare Kherwārī ālō .
There is a future passive participle in bō , which can also be used for the future , as in karᵃbō , it is to be done , i.e., ( we ) shall do .
It seems that the syllable gō ( feminine gī ) may be added to all these forms without affecting the sense .
The past participle ends in iō .
From this past tenses are formed exactly as in Hindōstānī .
The Perfect sometimes combines the past participle with the verb substantive into one word .
Karᵃnō , to do , makes its past participle kiō or kīnō .
The present participle is mārᵃtō , striking ; the infinitive , mārᵃnō , to strike ; and the conjunctive participle , mār , mār-gē , or mār-kē , having struck .
I-go , this ; mgū-o , that , are given as demonstrative pronouns .
Interrogative pronouns are sāg and khi-go , who ?
The indefinite particle chhang , also , is added to interrogative bases in order to form indefinite pronouns ; thus , sāg-chhang , anybody ; ti-chhang , anything .
The suffix āng is added to denote an object of the first person singular in īy-āng-ye , give me .
There is said to be a negative suffix - ī- , and the negative imperative is formed by adding man ’ to .

Name of dialecṭOrigiṇThe Musalmān armies imposed their language on their co-religionists in the Deccan from the first .
Without , however , going so far as that , it is not correct to look upon Dakhinī as a corrupt form of speech .
Such are , for instance , the employment of the oblique genitive as a base for declension in phrases like mērē-kū , to me , where the standard would have mujh-kō .
Only in one respect can Dakhinī be called a corrupt language .
I here give a brief account of the main points in which the dialect differs from standard Hindōstānī .
Agent ......nē , nī .
The Relative , Correlative , and Interrogative Pronouns are , The Hindōstānī Dative-Accusatives jisē , plur .
The Neuter Interrogative Pronoun is kyā or kā , what ?, oblique form kāhē , kāhī , or kī .
CONJUGATION .
The Present Participle ends in tā , or , sometimes , in at or t , as in mārtā or mārat , striking ; dēt , giving .
The Past Participle ends in ā , or sometimes in yā .
The feminine plural ends in yā~ .
The irregular forms are as in Standard Hindōstānī .
This participle is sometimes used with the genitive of the subject , as in woh mērā mārā hai , he is killed of me , i.e.
Other forms of the postposition , attached to either mār or mārē , are kē , kar , kar-kē , kar-kō , kar-kar , kȭ , ka .
The conjugation of the Active Verb closely agrees with that of Standard Hindōstānī .
In Madras the second person plural is the same as the first and third persons , as in tum mārē~ , you may strike .
The present subjunctive ( old present ) is often employed as a present or even as a future .
gyā~ ) to the present subjunctive or old present ; thus , maĩ mārū~-gā , I shall strike .
The singular is commonly used for the plural , as ham mārēgā or mārē~gē , we shall strike .
In the case of transitive verbs custom differs .
Sometimes nē is used , but here it is pleonastic , and the construction is the same as when it is not used , the verb still agreeing in gender and number with the subject , and not with the object .
The same idioms are employed , according to locality , for all the past tenses of transitive verbs .
It is often employed with intransitive verbs , e.g.
Throughout its history , the city also gave its name to its dependencies and to the surrounding district , and Kanaujī therefore means , literally , the dialect of the old kingdom of Kanauj .
It is also found in Cawnpore and Hardoi , but in the latter district it is more or less mixed ( according to locality ) with the Awadhī dialect of Eastern Hindī spoken to its east , and in the former it shows signs of the influence not only of Awadhī , but of Bundēlī .
Language BoundarieṣKanaujī is bounded on the west and north-west by Braj Bhākhā and on the south by Bundēlī .
The only important one is that , north of the Ganges and in Cawnpore , there is a tendency to add a short i to a word ending in a consonant .
I have already said that in Cawnpore and Hardoi the dialect is mixed .
Literature.Asa literary language Kanaujī has been overshadowed by its more powerful neighbour Braj Bhākhā .
AuthoritieṣThe only work dealing with Kanaujī which I have seen is Mr.Kellogg ’ s Hindī grammar .
The dialect employed differs considerably from that illustrated in the following pages .
It prefers the termination ō to the au of that dialect .
Both dialects are fond of adding u to the end of nouns which in ordinary Hindōstānī terminate in a consonant .
With reference to the accompanying skeleton grammar of Kanaujī the following additional facts may be noted : As in other dialects there is a tendency to drop h between two vowels .
Strong masculine tadbhava adjectives ( including the genitive case and participles ) , which in Standard Hindī end in ā , in Kanaujī end in ō .
Strong masculine substantives , however , end in ā , and this ā is in some cases ( mostly nouns of relationship ) not changed to ē in the oblique singular .
Weak masculine tadbhavas , which in Hindī end in a silent consonant , in Kanaujī optionally end in u .
This termination u is optionally retained in the oblique singular , as , ghar-kō or gharu-kō , of a house 
We sometimes find the past tense of a neuter verb used impersonally with the subject in the agent case .
This is , of course , opposed to the rules of Standard Hindī .
The past tenses of dēnā , lēnā and jānā are , as in Bundēlī , daō , laō , gaō .
KANAUJĪ SKELETON GRAMMAR .

Thus , past participles , karō and marō .
North of the Ganges , as a rule , the two languages gradually merge into each other , and we notice an intermediate dialect , such as , for instance , the Siripuriā of Eastern Purnea , which it is difficult to define either as the one or as the other language .
For instance , as has already been shown , there is a tract in the Deogarh Sub-division of the Sonthal Parganas , in which both Maithilī and Bengali , besides various Muṇḍā languages , are spoken side by side , without uniting into one general , composite speech .
There it suddenly stops , face to face with the various forms of Bihārī which compose the Aryan speech of the highlands of Chota Nagpur .
These have retained their own language , though , as could only be expected of a small people living for generations in contact with a great people , they have not resisted the temptation of borrowing words and grammatical forms from those amongst whom they live .
It is not , as in the case of Siripuriā , the language of a border tract between a country whose language is Bengali , and a country whose language is Bihārī .
In Manbhum this language is principally spoken by people of the Kuṛmī caste , who are numerous in the Districts of Chota Nagpur , and in the Orissa Tributary State of Mayurbhanja .
instead of a hard , r .The two quite distinct tribes have been mixed up in the Census , but as their habitats are also distinct , the following figures may be taken as showing with considerable accuracy the number of Kuṛmīs in the area under consideration : These Kuṛmīs do not all speak corrupted Bihārī .
It will thus be understood that the figures for the people speaking it will not agree with those given above for the tribe .
It will be most convenient to call this form of speech ‘ Eastern Magahī ’ for none of the local names applies sufficiently to all the speakers .
It is , in Manbhum , written in the Bengali character , and this has led to its having been described by some as a dialect of that language .
In the word hĩchhā , for ichchā , a wish , h has been prefixed .
Its genitive case is ṭek , as in ghaṛi-ṭek bādē , after a space of twenty minutes .
Ek-ṭā , is used in the same sense , as in ek-ṭā muniś-kē ḍāki-ke , having called a servant .
The Bihārī termination lāy or lāi is also used for the Dative , as in chārāo-lāi , for feeding .
This is a Bihārī termination .
This is the commonest termination of all .
If a noun ends in ā there are irregularities .
The Instrumental and Locative , are formed by adding ē .
The Plural is usually the same as the Singular , but in the case of human beings gulā is added .
The Relative and Correlative Pronouns are j:ē , and sē .
The Verb .
Finite Verbs .
Habitual Past .

2nd Person .
3rd Person .
In the case of Intransitive verbs sometimes the Bihārī custom of dropping all terminations is followed , as in gēl , he went .
1st Person .
( b ) Intransitive verbs , maral-āhã , I have died .
( b ) Intransitive verb , āol-āhek , he has come ; gēl-āhek , he has gone .
Before the auxiliary the final l of the Past Participle of an intransitive verb , becomes r .Thus gēr ( for gēl ) rahã , I had gone ; gēr rahē , he had gone .
As examples of Compound Verbs , we have dēi-delāk , he gave ; dauṛi j:āi-ke , having run , and others .
Idiom The Negative is nehi or nihi .
The following specimens come from Manbhum , and are in the Bengali character .
In its western half its language is Aryan , and towards the east the language is the Tibeto-Burman Kanāwᵃrī or Kanaurī and other connected forms of speech .
It will be seen that the form of jha is the same as that of ja , which is an apt illustration of the tendency in these Pahāṛī languages to drop the aspiration of sonant aspirates ( gha , jha , ḍha , dha , and bha ) : 
Thus , āpṇē is written å .Non-initial long vowels are often represented by their initial forms , and at the same time the letter å is often used as a sort of scaffold on which to build an initial ō .
Instances of the use of initial vowels instead of non-initials are å for lwāṭē and å for gāṇō .
The letter ē is sometimes used instead of i as in å for pākŏṛiyō , and similarly ō is used instead of u , as in å for hāũ .
It will be observed that it only occurs after long vowels , and possibly it may be ( as in Ṭākrī ) merely an indication of length .
We have seen how most words written with an aspirated consonant for the first letter , in Kiū~ṭhalī , transfer the aspiration to the end of the first syllable .
In the declension of nouns we have the occasional Sirājī change of ō to ŏ , as in mānsō-rē , of a man , but sū~gŏrŏ-rē , for sū~gŏrō-rē , of the swine .
For the personal pronouns there are , as usual , several forms differing slightly from those found in standard Kiū~ṭhalī .
ē or yah , this , has its emphatic form ēī , this very ; and its oblique ( regular ) ӗṣ Sē , he , that , has its agent tēṇē ( tīṇī ) , and its oblique tӗs , tē , or tӗh .
The Verb Substantive in the present tense is sō or āsō .
The conjugation of the active verb calls for few remarks , as it is practically the same as in Kiū~ṭhalī .
The conjunctive participle is formed by adding ī ( ē ) or iyō , as in Simla Sirājī .
Inceptive compounds are formed with laggṇū ( past part .
Completive compounds are formed with mukṇū and the conjunctive participle , as in ghŏrchē khā ( i ) yō bēchiyō mukē , ( when ) he had completely eaten and sold the property .
The Pāwᵃrī dialect is a form of Gujarātī Bhīlī .
Their northern origin is confirmed by their language , which has several points of connexion with the Bārēl dialect of Udepur , and with the Bhīl dialects of Rajpipla , Ali Rajpur , and Barwani .
Vowels are often nasalized , as in tu or tũ , thou ; āvē or ā~vē , I shall come .
So also aspiration is lost in words like gōḍō , a horse ; gōr , a house ; bāi , a brother .
Note the frequent use of the suffix lō , which is also found in Ali Rajpur and Chhota Udepur .
This suffix does not seem to affect the meaning .
The oblique form is the same as in Gujarātī Bhīlī .
The subject of a verb is put in the case of the agent , when the predicate is the past tense of a transitive verb .
The usual case suffixes are , Agent and instrumental , ē .Dative , hā , n , or no suffix .
Adjectives follow the Rājasthānī and Gujarātī system of being put into the locative or agent case , when agreeing with a noun in that case .
Numerals .
Pronouns .
The demonstrative pronouns are chu , chō , and pōlō , he , that ; fem .
The feminine singular does not occur in the specimens .
Verbs .
The past tense is ōtō , plural , ōtā .
The usual form of the present tense is made by adding lō to the present participle ; thus , jāt-lō , goes ; plur .
The past tense is formed by adding yō or lō ; thus , gōyō or gōylō , he went ; pōḍyō or pōḍlō , he fell .
Another future ends in ṇē or nē~ and thus has the same form as the infinitive ; thus , jāṇē or jāṇē~ , I shall go , I am off ; āpṇē , if I give .
The suffix ān , i.e.
The negative with imperatives is na .
AUTHORITIES Hodgson , B .H ., Continuation of the Comparative Vocabulary of the several Dialects of the Kirăntes Language .
Lōhōrōng is most closely related to Bālāli and connected dialects .
There are three numbers , the singular , the dual , and the plural .
Mō , he , is also used as a demonstrative pronoun meaning ‘ that ’ .
They can be changed to indefinite pronouns by adding sāng ; thus , āsā-sāng , anyone ; imāng-sāng , anything .
There seems to be a suffix nga denoting a subject of the first person singular .
A negative imperative is formed by prefixing e ’ ; thus , e ’ - dūbe and e ’ - tōnge , do not make .

Nouns .
Gender is distinguished by using different terms , or else by adding suffixes or words indicating the sex .
We have no information about the suffixes added in the dual and the plural .
Ngāka , of , is perhaps miswritten for ngākhā , and contains the suffix ngā , by .
The number of speakers is estimated to be 2 , 428 .
It will be sufficient to give one specimen of it , a version of the Parable of the Prodigal Son , and a brief account of the principal points in which the Grammar differs from that of Standard Kiū~ṭhalī .
On the other hand in bhūkhāī , by hunger , we have ī used instead of ē , the termination of the instrumental .
As examples of the metathesis of the letter h , we may quote āhth , a hand , and gŏhr , a house .
In Kiū~ṭhalī the oblique form of masculine nouns ending in consonants is made by adding ō .
The same termination is even added to a noun ending in a vowel , in mū~ŏ , ( before thy ) face .
The Genitive takes rā ( rō ) as usual .
For the Ablative , besides dā ( dō , dū ) , there are khū and kiū~ .
For the Personal Pronouns there are several forms .
The Verb Substantive has many forms for the present .
The Singular and Plural are the same , and so are the second and third persons .
The Present Participle is , as usual , employed as an infinitive of purpose , as in chārdō chhāṛō , sent him to feed ( swine ) .
For the Past Conditional , we have rŏndō thiyō , I might have remained .
For Compound Verbs , we have : Intensives , such as mŏrē ( for mŏrī ) gō-thō ; ōē ( for hōī ) gō .
Inceptives are formed with the Present Participle , as in rŏndō lāgō , he began to remain .

On the other hand , the influence of Pañjābī sometimes makes these nouns form the direct form in ā instead of in ō .
The following are examples of the correct use of the direct and oblique forms : mairō pūt mōyō thō ( Hindī , mērā pūt muā thā ) , my son was dead ; apṇā mā-tah ( Hindī , apnē māl-sē ) , from his own share ; chaṅgā admī ( Hindī , chaṅgē ādmī ) , good men ; is-kā pairā~-mā~ ( Hindī , is-kē pairȭ-mē~ ) , on his feet ; apṇā dōstā~-kanah ( Hindī , apnē dōstȭ-sāth ) , with ( my ) own friends : chaṅgī trīmat ( Hindī , chaṅgī strī ) , a good woman ; is-kī aṅgṛī-mā~ ( Hindī , is-kī angulī-mē~ ) , on his finger .

VERBS .
Other examples are karū~ hai , I am making , used as a present subjunctive , ( that ) I may make ( merriment with my friends ) ; karū~ thō , I was making .
The Present Participle is used to form a Habitual Past .
In the Simple Present , which is also used as a present subjunctive , there are some irregularities observable in the specimens .
The main dialect of the State of Chamba is known as Chamĕāḷī , and is a form of Western Pahāṛī .
T.Grahame Bailey gives an account of this dialect in his Languages of the Northern Himalayas ( London , 1908 ) , and the following sketch of its main peculiarities is based upon this , with a few additions collected from the annexed specimen , a version of the Parable of the Prodigal Son .
Declension .
The case postpositions are .
While the oblique form singular of nouns corresponding to ghar usually ends in ē , it sometimes ends in ā , so that from mulkh , a country , we have both mulkhē and mulkhā .
Other pronouns are kōī , some one , any one ; kichchh , something , anything .
The Active verb follows Kāṅgrā .
Future masc .
This tense does not change for person .
Mr.Grahame Bailey gives the present tense as formed in the usual way , by suffixing the verb substantive to the present participle ; thus , mārdā-hā~ , I strike .
It will be remembered that the Ḍōgrā present participle may end in nā .
The following are examples of irregular verbs : Note the short a in ayā , jandā , jaṅghā , and galayā .
The Gujarātī spoken by the educated classes of the Peninsula of Kathiawar is , as usual , the standard dialect .
There is the usual uncertain vowel scale .
The past participle of jaw ũ , to go , is always written jīy ô , although the ō in other past participles is written as in the standard ; thus , hatō ( not hat ô ) , was ; paḍyō ( not paḍy ô ) , fallen : .
At the commencement of a word , s is aspirated and # written in the vernacular # which bears the same relation to # s , that # kh , does to # k .
The letter h , when medial , is elided .
The letter l .usually becomes r .
A final vowel is optionally nasalized .
Declension .
Another oblique form is made by adding ya .
The plural is also indicated by the addition of ũ .
The ē of the agent-locative is often nasalized .
Pronouns .
The pronoun of the third person is tē , tī , or ī .
’ The word bhaī , is also employed with a pronoun of the third person .
Conjugation .
In other respects the conjugation of the verb closely follows the standard dialect , allowing for phonetic changes .
The past tense is hatō or tō , as in other northern Gujarat dialects .
The present tense of the finite verb is : I strike .
The auxiliary is often written with chh .
The past participle is māryō .
The imperative ends in ya .
The past participle of verbs the roots of which end in ā ( passives ) takes the termination ṇō .
The verb jaw ũ , to go , has its present participle jätō , not jatō , and its past tense jīy ô .
Similarly , thaw ũ , to be , has its infinitive thāw ũ , and its present participle thātō .
Forms such as kwān , Tibetan gon , cloth ; chā , Tibetan za , eat ; pli and bli , Tibetan bzhi , four ; pre and bre , Tibetan brgyad , eight , and so forth , in which hard and soft consonants interchange , seem to show that the soft consonants of Tibetan have developed into soft aspirates , and further into hard sounds .
There are several compound consonants such as kl , gl , pl , bl , ml , kr , gr , pr , br , mr , ky , gy , jy , and so forth .
We have no information about tones or accentuation .
There are no articles , but the numeral ki , gi , one , is often used as a kind of indefinite article ; thus , ā-bā-ki , a father ; jhyā-bā ki mhi , a good man ; ki jhyā-bā mi-lā , of a good man .
If it is necessary to distinguish the plural , words such as kāde , kāte , or gāde , many ; dugu ( Tibetan dgu ) , many , are added .
The subject of intransitive verbs and the object are not distinguished by adding any suffix .
The same suffix is also used to denote the instrument .
nyāī , by me , seems to show that the suffix of this case is originally s , which has become i after a preceding vowel .
A locative and terminative is formed by adding ri as in Gurung ; thus , yāmbunāg-ri , in a city ; dim-ri , in the house ; khāre-ri , upon the neck .
Some postpositions are added to the genitive ; thus , li-chhā and li-sang , behind ; ngā-chhā , behind ; nindi-ri , for the sake of .
There are , however , also other suffixes in use ; thus , ā-khām-na , unable ; kyāng-no , all ; thā-cho , straight ; kok-teng , crooked ; mlāngai , black ; tāra , white ; bāla , red .
Numerals .
The higher numbers are counted in twenties .
Pronouns .
Demonstrative pronouns are chu , this ; the , u-chu , ho-ju , ho-jā , that .
By adding the indefinite particle nu or no indefinite pronouns are effected ; thus , khāl-che-nu , by anyone ; tiki-no , anything ; khāi-mā-ye-no , ever .
The suffix m in forms such as pin-ji-m , he gave , in the Darjeeling specimens , is perhaps a corresponding suffix of the third person .
It is also possible to suggest the influence of other dialects in which the use of personal suffixes is quite regular .
we have a base ni .
The most common suffix of the present is apparently lā ; thus , mu-lā , am ; rop-lā , strike .
Chi is perhaps the correct form after hard consonants .
Such forms are apparently only used in the third person .
The present suffix lā is also used with the meaning of a future ; thus , pāng-lā , I shall say .
Verbal nouns and participles .
The base alone is also used as a verbal noun ; thus , chā ā-khām-na , to-eat unable .
Forms such as tā-lā jhin-ji , having been , perhaps contain the same suffix and a postposition jhin-ji , finishing , from , after .
Other adverbial participles are formed from the various verbal nouns by adding postpositions ; thus , pāng-mā , saying in , while saying ; pāng-min , while saying ; bi-se , by saying , if you say .
A particle nā or nām is sometimes added ; thus , rup-si-nā , gathering ; khā-ji-nām , coming , in the Darjeeling specimens .
Passive voice .
It is perhaps a verb substantive .
It is formed from chā-bā , to eat , by aspirating the initial consonant .
The usual order of words is subject , object , verb .
A list of Standard Words and Phrases from the Nepal Darbar will be found on pp .
It is usually called Dēśī , that is the language of the Dēś , the country par excellence .
These mixed forms of speech will be dealt with in connection with the Marāṭhī of the Konkan .
The Dekhan form of the language is also spoken in the towns of Bijapur , the chief language of which district is Kanarese , and , to some extent , in Dharwar .
The difference between the two dialects is not , however , so important that any serious disadvantage will arise from the whole total being put down as belonging to Dēśī .
The speakers of Marāṭhī in those parts of India where it is not a vernacular have been returned as speaking Marāṭhī , without mention of sub-dialect .
Standard Marāṭhī in the Dekhan form , has , however , been reported from several districts outside the territory where that dialect is spoken as a vernacular .
The ensuing estimates of the number of speakers have been forwarded by the local authorities , In Berar , where a slightly different dialect is current in most districts , settlers from the Dekhan have brought the Standard form of the language with them .
The revised figures are as follows , In the Central Provinces the language of Poona and surrounding districts is sometimes called Punēkarī .
Though the Bhonslas of Nagpur afterwards held sway over the country from 1791 till it was annexed by the British in 1818 , the Marāṭhī of those districts is still the Dekhan form of the language .
The form mī is used in addition to myā~ as the case of the agent of the personal pronoun of the first person ; thus , mī pāp kēlē~ āhē , by-me sin done is .
Thus , yētē~ , I ( neuter ) come ; yētē , she comes .
The real home language is the Marāṭhī dialect of the Central and Northern Konkan .
The principal language of Thana is the dialect of Marāṭhī which , with slight local variations , is spoken from Daman to Rajapur .
The principal language of Nasik is Marāṭhī , shading off into Khāndēśī in the north .
It is , however , almost certain that it does not materially differ from the form which that language assumes in the neighbouring Ahmadnagar .
The former is a Bhīl dialect , and the latter will be dealt with in connection with the Marāṭhī spoken in the Central and Northern Konkan .
Above the hills , however , the difference between the two forms of speech is so unimportant that no inconvenience can possibly arise from the Nasik dialect being classed under the standard form of Marāṭhī current in the Dekhan .
We may only note that t is often added to the second person plural of the past tense of intransitive verbs .
In Sholapur the same form of Marāṭhī is the principal language in the north and the west .
The principal language of the Satara District , as also of the States Phaltan and Audh in the Satara Agency is Marāṭhī with the usual characteristics of the Dekhan .
The dialect of Belgaum closely agrees with that of Satara .
The numeral ‘ one ’ is written yēk , a state of affairs which is common in many parts of the territory in which Marāṭhī is a vernacular .
The verb hōṇē~ , to become , forms the past tense dzāhᵃlā , where Standard has dzhālā .
The dialect closely agrees with that of Satara .
In other respects the dialect does not differ from that current in neighbouring districts .
They all exhibit the same form of the language as that current in Satara and neighbouring districts .
Their number is estimated to be between 500 and 1 , 000 .
Two specimens and a list of standard words and phrases have been prepared by Babu Bisharup Singh in the Pūrūm village in the valley of Manipur .
It is , however , more closely connected with such languages as Hallām , Langrong , Rāngkhōl , etc.
It is often almost impossible to state whether a vowel is long or short .
An accented final vowel is probably long , but is shortened when the stress is transferred to another syllable .
We have , however , no information as to where the stress should come , and the marking of long vowels by the original writer being rather inconsistent , it is impossible to state the rules for the shortening .
Diphthongs occur very frequently , but they are , in most cases , interchangeable with single vowels .
Hard and soft consonants are sometimes interchangeable .
S and y are apparently used alternatively in the suffix of the past tense , yaū , yo , and saū , so .
Compare Meithei , where r is substituted for l after a vowel .
Kh and h are apparently interchangeable in the numeral a-khā , one .
A final ng seems often only to mark a nasal pronunciation of the preceding vowel .
Prefixes and Suffixes .
This prefix is sometimes the possessive pronoun of the third person ; thus , a-kūt-ā , his-hand-on , but has usually been superseded as such by ma .
Compare , however , Prefixes and Suffixes , above .
The usual suffixes , in the case of human beings , are pā , male , and nū , female .
In mi a-khā-pā , a man , the suffix pā is added to the numeral a-khā , one .
The suffixes chal-pā , tang-pā , and pi-nū or bi-nū , are compound suffixes .
Case .
It marks the personal object with causative verbs ; thus , kai-ta sē-lo na-sūk a-khā chang-pi , me hired thy-servant one to-be-cause ; a-pā a-khā-dā ron-pi-so , man one to-wear-hecaused .
The suffix of the agent is nā ; thus , ma-pā-nā ma-ral sam-sū-so , his father his-pro-perty divided .
This nā is perhaps different word , and is probably the demonstrative pronoun nā , this .
The stem alone , or with an o added , is used as a Vocative ; thus ka-sa-nāū , my son ; a-pā-o , O father .
Adjectives .
When the adjectives are used as verbs the ordinary verbal suffixes are added .
Adjectives usually follow , but sometimes also precede the noun they qualify .
The Numerals are given in the list of words .
The possessive pronouns ka , my ; na , thy ; a and ma , his , are used in the genitive , but also the fuller forms .
The plural of the second person is nangai , i.e.
Demonstrative pronouns .
There are no Relative pronouns .
Interrogative pronounṣ A-tū , who ?
Another interrogative pronoun occurs in na-ming alo tiyāmē , what is thy name ?
The base of the interrogative pronoun tū is also used as an indefinite pronoun .
Verbs .
The root alone , without any suffix , is freely used to denote present and past times .
The suffix ā , which usually forms adverbial clauses and conjunctive participles , may be added , apparently without changing the meaning .
A suffix sā occurs in forms such as chang-sā , it is ; a-thiyang-sā , he was dead ; a-māng-sā , he was lost .
It seems to be an assertive suffix , compare Burmese chhē ( pronounced s ’ ä ) .
All these suffixes seem to be derived from a common source , probably a verb yaū or zaū , to finish , to complete .
It is worth noting , however , that soi or sŭi is a sign of the past tense in Bodo languages .
Siyang , siyā and sēng seem to contain a verb si , perhaps meaning ‘ to be ’ .
Piyaū , piyo , and piyang seem to contain a verb pi .
All these forms are , therefore , probably no real past tenses , but compound verbs .
A Present Definite seems to be formed by adding ang or ing ; thus , pi-yang-ē , he is giving ; kai-nā wēl-song-ing , I am striking ; and probably also kai thēng-song-ing , I 
This tense may also be formed , in a periphrastic way , by means of the verb am , to be , to remain .
The usual suffix of the Future is ang , as in Lushēi and partly in Khongzāi .
Another suffix is tik , in ril-thing-tik-ē , I will say ; sa-wāi lūko bak-ā won hop-tik-ē tā ning-ting-a-chaū , ‘ husks even eating belly fill-will ’ saying wishing-after-even , though he wished to fill his belly even with husks .
The suffix of the Infinitive of purpose is ang ; compare Future .
The Relative participles have been mentioned in connection with Relative pronouns .
The latter form seems to be the past tense , perhaps used as a relative participle .
Compound verbs are freely formed in order to modify the meaning of the principal verb .
In most cases , however , only one suffix is added .
The verb pi , to give , forms Causatives .
Other words added in order to form compound verbs are hū , together ; lāk , begin ; sēr , back , again .
Compare , however , the suffix of the past tense .
The usual order of words is subject , direct object , indirect object , verb .
Lahndā cannot be called the language of the District of Pesn|awar , any more than it can be called the language of Kohat .
The population of Peshawar in 1901 was 788 , 707 , of whom 619,025 spoke that language .
There is no territorial division between the two languages .
Here , not only are Paṣh.tōand Hindkō spoken , but also Hindōstānī , Pañjābī and other languages of various parts of India .
Here the mixture of languages is so great that some , not without reason , describe this form of Hindkō , locally known as Peshāwarī , as a mongrel product of city life .
The first is a version of the Parable of the Prodigal Son in the language of the district , and the second is a ghazal , or ode , in the language of the city .
Thus vich is used as a preposition , not as a postposition , and we have gham mah.shar-dē-nēfor mah.shar-dēgham-nē , an order of words entirely un-Indian , and due to the memory of the Persian gham-ӗ-mah.shaṛThe influence of Pañjābī and Hindōstānī is very strong .
In verbs , the infinitive ends in ṇā or nā , as in Pañjābī ( not in un .
In the latter example , note that āwāz is treated as masculine , not as feminine .
The letter d is not cerebralized as in Thaḷī .
The following pronominal forms occur : mä~ , I ; manē , case of agent ; manū~ , or mänū~ ( Specimen II ) , to me ; mērā , my .
Other pronouns are as in Standard Lahndā .
There is a negative verb substantive nayyā~ , I am not , equivalent to the Standard nimhū~ .
It will be observed that transitive verbs do not insert ē as in the Standard .
For irregular past participles we may note : piā , not pēā , fallen .
According to Mr.Diack , ‘ the glen is a very deep and narrow one , extending from the mountain ridge ( at that point impassable or nearly so ) forming the tri-junction of the Bias , Chenab , and Spiti watersheds down to the valley of the Parbati , a large tributary of the Bias / from the east .
I am indebted to Mr.G .C .L .Howell , Assistant Commissioner of Kulu , for two specimens and a list of Standard Words and Phrases in Kanāshī .
Mr.Howell writes that he has not as yet been able to make a thorough study of Kanāshī , and that several points in pronunciation and grammar still remain uncertain .
The materials have been noted down in Roman and vernacular characters .
Mr.Howell states that he cannot hear any aspirates in the dialect , but that his clerks say they can .
Thus the suffix of the dative occurs as uj , uzh , and uz .
Tones are said to be a prominent feature of the dialect .
The accent is usually thrown as far back as possible .
There are no articles , but i , the shortest form of the first numeral , is often used as a kind of indefinite article ; thus , i maṛshang-ka-di , with a man .
Gender is distinguished in the common way , by using different words or adding terms denoting the sex ; thus , maṛshang , man ; beṭṛī , woman : chho , son ; chīme , daughter ; rāng , horse ; mīch rāng , mare ; kui , dog ; mīch kutī , bitch .
There are two numbers , the singular and the plural .
The subject of intransitive verbs is not distinguished by means of any suffix .
The suffix of the dative is uj , the final sound of which is stated to be a semiconsonant .
Adjectives .
way by putting the compared noun in the ablative or the locative ; thus , du-ka bau du-ka ringz ( - ka ) ni ts lamas to , his brother his sister from tall is ; sab-ka-ni ts akli , all from wise ; sab-a tek ’ , all among great .
The forms with ny have been taken from the texts written in the Tibetan character .
Pronouns .
There are apparently no dual forms and no double forms of the plural of the first person , denoting the exclusive and inclusive plural .
Indefinite pronouns are formed from the same bases ; thus , hati , any one ; hasi , by any one ; chhigi , anything .
Relative pronouns are yang-s , by whom ; yang , whatever .
There are no certain instances of the use of suffixes to denote an object or to add a reflexive meaning .
There is at least a strong tendency to distinguish the person of the subject by adding suffixes to the verb ; thus , boke-k , I went ; boke-n , wentest ; bok , he went .
In the first person singular a k is added ; thus , shigu-ta-k , I die .
192 , gu toz tod-ke-k , I was beating , shows that tot-ke-k is the past .
The same is probably also the case with tashang , is .
Forms such as hashig and hashik , became ; achig , arose , have already been mentioned under the head of present time .
Imperative .
Verbal nouns and participles .
Negative voice .
The order of words is said to be comparatively free .
The 1901 Census figures for the dialect are as follows .
A version of the Parable of the Prodigal Son and a list of Standard Words and Phrases have been kindly prepared for the purposes of this Survey by the Nepal Darbar , and they will be printed below .
Beames , J ., Outlines of Indian Philology , with a map shewing the distribution of Indian Languages .
Appendix A contains numerals , and Appendix B personal pronouns in Magar .
Beames , John , On the Magar Language of Nepal .
Campbell , Sir George , Specimens of Languages of India .
The remarks on Mãgarī grammar which follow are based on the materials printed below and on Mr.Beames ’ sketch , which should be consulted for further details .
The vowels are sometimes marked as long and sometimes as short .
M , n , r , and l are frequently aspirated , and the same is , according to Mr.Beames , the case with all consonants in excited talk ; thus , ḍhānghonhe , I see , I see , instead of ḍāngone .
Article .
Nouns .
It is probably a demonstrative pronoun .
Case .
The suffix of the genitive is o or u ; thus , bay-o , of a father ; des-ũ , of a country .
In forms such as bhar-mi-kung , of a man , the final vowel has been accompanied by a nasalization .
Adjectives .
Numerals precede the word they qualify .
Indefinite pronouns are formed by adding the indefinite particle ra to interrogatives ; thus , su-ye-ra , by any one ; hi-ra , anything .
It is , however , combined with the relative participle , and not with the finite tenses of the verb .
Note finally the reflexive pronoun laho , own .
Verb substantive .
A compound present is formed by adding m-ne or mi-ne , i.e., the verb substantive and the suffix of the conjunctive participle .
Mr.Beames gives mo-ne , or , after consonants , o-ne , instead , and calls this form an aorist because it is used with reference to past , present , or future occurrences .
Mr.Beames also mentions a suffix lang or nang ; thus , nang-ke sāt-nang , I will strike you ; rākh-lang , I bring .
Forms such as mhā-le , was lost , are properly forms of the present .
Nung-ne , went , and similar forms , probably also belong to the present time .
Verbal nouns and participles .
This form is sometimes also used as a verbal noun ; thus , harkha zāt-cha , to make merry ; ku-chi birin-chu : āle , whom-by sending may be ?
The conjunctive participle is formed by adding mü , or , after consonants , nu : ; thus , yā-mü , having given ; rākh-nü , having brought .
An adverbial participle , which also has the meaning of a conjunctive participle , is formed by adding the suffix nā or nāng ; thus , de-nā , saying ; rā-nāng , on coming .
Causative verb .
Some causatives are apparently formed by adding k ; thus , rā-ke , to come ; rāk-ke , to bring ; bilāk-nu , causing to put on , from bilh-ke , to put on .
A list of Standard Words and Phrases will be found on p .254 and ff.
This is the language of the Tōrwāls , who occupy the upper portion of the main Swat Valley for about sixty miles from Aryana to Chiroli , and the Chahil Darrah , a valley running to the east from the Swat Valley a little above Chiroli .
The separation of the two portions of the tribe has , however , produced considerable differences in the dialects now spoken .
Those who remained behind in Swat were the ancestors of the present Tōrwālṣ Tōrwālī certainly belongs to the Dardic family , and the mode of formation of the feminine , and some of the verbal forms , show clearly that it is connected with Kāshmīrī .
It is most nearly akin to the language of the Indus Valley which is described by Colonel Biddulph under the name of Gowro .
The grammar of the specimens differs considerably from that here given , and is subsequently discussed : 
Other vowels and consonants as usual in other Indian languages .
NOUNS .
The Passive voice is formed by the use of the Auxiliary verb bajūsa , to go .
The following incomplete account of Tōrwālī Grammar is based on the specimens .
NOUNS , Declension .
The Agent case is usually the same as the nominative ; thus , bap banū , by the father it was said , the father said .
As a matter of fact the Nominative is frequently used instead of the Agent .

Examples of Pronominal Adjectives are , Sēh māsh , that man ; Tē watan yat , on that country ; āh pūchh , this son ; as ghō-chē , of this horse ; as shai , that thing .
VERBS A .Auxiliary Verbs and Verbs Substantive .
In kā ehhal chhī , what matter is it ?, chhī is possibly feminine .

This dialect is spoken in the Kōhistān on both banks of the Indus , between that river and the Swat valley on the one side , and on the other between it and the watershed of the Jhelam and its affluents .
Maiyā~ has several dialects .
Another is spoken round Kōlī and Pālus , in Jalkōṭ , Batērā , Marēn , Gobērā and Chilīṣ It is practically the dialect of the west side of the Kōhistān here .
It is the dialect of the east side of the Kōhistāṇ The people are chiefly Shāh Khēlṣ A fourth dialect is spoken more to the south , and is that illustrated below .
In order to show the close connexion with Chilīs , another column has been added īn the list of Standard Words showing the corresponding words in that language .
2 Tribes of the Hindoo Koosh , p .10 , and Appendix C .The following grammatical sketch of Maiyā~ is based on the specimens and on the List of Standard Words : I .NOUNS .
Similarly appear to be declined māsh , a man ; ghō , a horse ; gō , a bull ; gharī~ , a woman ; and jawāb , an answer .
Similarly appear to be declined puṭh , a son ; naukar , a servant ; ghōī , a mạre ; kāsar , a dog ; and kūsīr , a bitch .
So far as appears from the specimens , the Accusative and Agent cases are the same as the Nominative .
Adjectives do not appear to change for Gender or Number .
PRONOUNS .
The Agent case is used as the subject before transitive verbs in the past tenses .
Curiously enough , as appears from the list of Standard Words , the Agent , and not the Nominative , is used in the second person singular , and in the third person singular and plural of the Future .
Even before the past tenses , the use of the Agent is not always adhered to .
In spīte of these exceptional instances , the specimens show clearly that the Agent case is properly used before the past tenses of Transitive verbs .
III .– VERBS .
This is thū , for all the persons and both numbers .
Besides thū , we have also ā~s , plural ā~sū , for all persons .
hōn-shat , I shall be ; bā-shat , literally , I shall go , is also used in the same sense .
Active Verb .
Present Participle , kuṭa , beating .
Imperative , kuṭagal , beat .
In the following cases , we miss the termination gal : hō , be ; bah , go ; bhai , sit ; ai , come ; ōlihō , stand ; mariyā , die ; dai , see daigal above , give ; nihāla , look .
The plural may apparently add an a , for we have khānta , they eat .
In the Parable , this is used as a Past , in bhākun nī baita , he went not inside .
Marīā is translated ‘ I die , ’ but perhaps it is a Past Participle , and means ‘ I am dead ’ .
Definite Present , Only two examples , both of the same verb , are fortheoming .
Future , kuṭagal-ashat , I shall beat , for all persons and both numbers .
is translated , ‘ I will arise , ’ but the word is a Past , and probably here means , ‘ having arisen ’ .
Transitive Verbs , kuṭagil , I beat , for all persons and both numbers .
In kaī~ nī dit , no one gave , dit is properly a present .
In none of the above-quoted instances has the form of the verb changed owing to the object being feminine .
The words marial , he died ; and lābayā , he was lost , do not belong to this group , and may be Past Participles .
Other instances of Transitive Verbs are , ghina-thū , thou hast bought ; kara-thū , he has , or I have , made ; chāla-thū , he has found ; dai-thū , thou hast given .
Passive , kuṭais-thū , I am or was beaten .
The Past is formed by adding the syllable ūz in the words chālūzīgā , he is recovered ; ghȭ khar .
The usual plural suffix is ku , thus , marrī , son ; marku , sons ; pal-ku , teeth .
Other cases are formed as in Gōṇḍī .
Numerals .
Pronouns .
The corresponding forms of the second person are miraḍ , you ; mīvā , your .
Verbs .
Dātān , I will go ; kettitān , I will say , are forms of the present , and mendēbān , I might be , is half Oṛiyā .
The conjunctive participle is regularly formed .
But no authority gives a description of the tribe or an account of the language .
The second specimen , an Aimol folk-tale , gives a very good idea of the language .
In all essential points of grammar the dialect is closely related to Rāngkhōl and connected languages .
The marking of long vowels is not consistent and apparently not always correct .
In other cases we find the same vowel sometimes marked as long , and sometimes as short .
Some vowels are interchangeable .
Concurring vowels are often contracted .
Final consonants are usually softened when a vowel is added .
Final consonants are sometimes silent .
Most of the prefixes and suffixes which occur in Aimol have a distinct meaning of their own and will be dealt with below .
There are no articles .
The prefixes a and ka , which often occur before nouns denoting relationship and parts of the body , are the possessive pronouns of the third and first persons .
Gender is only apparent in the case of animate nouns .
Pasal is also used as a male suffix ; thus , nāi pasal , child male , son .
There are two numbers , the singular and the plural .
The Nominative and the Accusative do not take any suffix .
The suffix in , by , by means of , denoting the agent , is usually added to the subject of a transitive verb .
The Genitive is often expressed by simply putting the governed before the governing noun .
The governed noun is often repeated by means of a possessive pronoun prefixed to the governing noun .
The Vocative does not require any suffix , but an ē is sometimes prefixed ; thus , ē-pā , O father .
Adjectives are usually preceded by the prefix a ; thus , a-sā , good ; a-sāng-a , high .
Adjectives usually follow , but occasionally also precede the noun they qualify .
A kind of superlative is also effected by adding cak ; thus , pūwon a-sā-tak , cloth good-much , the best cloth .
The numerals are given in the list of words .
There are no traces in the specimens of other generic prefixes .
The following are the Personal pronouns : Singular , Plural , A form nai , thou , seems to occur in kai yēng-a lal nai na-pēk-rang , me to property thou thou-give-wilt ; and tū yēng-ā nai-chok-mo , whom from thou-boughtest ?
The personal pronouns are inflected as nouns .
Ni in kai-ka-ni , mine ; nang-na-ni , thine , must be considered as the verb substantive .
They are all originally demonstrative pronouns .
Han-ko in pasal han-ko fai-loi-yā a-man-chē , man that field-to he-sent , seems to contain ha , the suffix of the agent , and the emphasising particle ko .
There are no relative pronouns .
The ordinary tenses of the verb can be used in the same way .
In the last instance the relative participle follows the qualified noun .
Interrogative pronounṣ Tū-mo , who ?
Oho-mo seems , therefore , to mean ‘ where ?’ An indefinite pronoun is effected by adding ūm to the pronoun tū ; thus , tūn-ūm pē-makū , any one gave not .
Verbs are conjugated in person and number by means of pronominal prefixes .
The singular prefixes sometimes occur with a verb in the plural .
239 an is used in the singular .
ani seems to be a demonstrative pronoun , and the literal translation is apparently ‘ what that-done ?’ The plural prefix is used when the subject comprises two words connected by means of lē , with .
The prefixes are sometimes omitted .
A suffix ā , which generally forms adverbial clauses and conjunctive participles , is sometimes added , apparently without changing the meaning .
So and sē are apparently assertive suffixes in sentences such as i-mo ani-tho-so , what are they doing ?
The suffix lāi has a similar function ; see Negative particle , below .
It is also used to denote the present time when the action of the verb is considered as an established fact .
A-ni-yoi , it is , it was , is sometimes added to a verb in order to emphasise that the action really takes place .
A suffix pē is apparently added in forms such as a-yū-pē , he kissed ; a-deng-pē , it fell ; a-lūt-pē , he entered , etc.
A Present definite is formed by prefixing la , or by adding the verb om , to be , to remain .
The suffix of the Future is ing , probably a postposition meaning ‘ for , ’ ‘ in order to ’ .
Another suffix of the future is rang .
The form chang-lang-rong , in na-swok khat chang-lang-rong , thy-servant one ( I ) be-will , seems to be connected with the imperative .
The suffix of the Imperative is ro , and in the first person plural rai .
Ta is prefixed to ro in na-pēk-ta-ro , give ; bēng-ta-ro , put , etc.
The past tense ending in yoi is used as a past verbal noun .
A suffix na seems to occur in a-hong-na-khan-a-ko , his-coming-time-at-just , as soon as he came .
The Relative participles have been mentioned with Relative pronouns .
Laū-chon-mi-kēng , a cultivator , contains the same word kēng , and is formed by prefixing the relative participle without any suffix to mi , a man .
The suffix lā forms a conjunctive participle which is substituted for the first of two co-ordinate imperatives .
In a-mā-ha-ko vē-jag-in-lā rūi-yā khit-ro , him beaten-having ropes-with bind , in-lā is the suffix in the second person singular .
The first of these sentences must be translated as a passive , the second as an active .
Compound verbs are freely formed in order to modify the meaning of the primary verb .
The prefixes ma and man form causatives .
En seems to have been prefixed to tho in kan-tho-in-ka-ta , probably for ka-en-tho-ing-ka-ta , I-arising .
Hong , to come , is used as a prefix in order to denote 
Desideratives are formed by adding nwom , to wish ; thus , lūt-nwom-lāi-mā , ( he ) to-enter-wished-not .
It is probably a verb substantive .
It is added to the verb when there is no interrogative pronoun ; thus , a-sūong-yoi-mo , has it been cooked ?
The usual order of words is subject , object , verb .
Before dealing with that form of speech it will be necessary to give a short account of some minor dialects of Berar and the Central Provinces which occupy a position like that of Gōṇḍī between Kanarese-Tamil and Telugu .
The points in which they differ from that language are , however , of sufficient importance to make it necessary to separate them from that form of speech .
The number of speakers has been estimated for the purposes of this Survey as followš – A few speakers are probably also found in Pusad , in the Basim district .
The Kōlāmī dialect differs widely from the language of the neighbouring Gōṇḍṣ In some points it agrees with Telugu , in other characteristics with Kanarese and connected forms of speech .
Haig , Captain Wolseley , A Comparative Vocabulary of the Gōṇḍi and Kōlāmī Languages .
The notes on Kōlāmī grammar which follow are based on the version of the Parable of the Prodigal Son printed below .
Nouns .
Pronouns .
Verbs .
The Verb substantive forms its present tense as follows .
There are no instances of real plural forms in the materials available .
The imperative takes no suffix , but r is added in the plural .
The negative verb is formed by adding tōten , to the base .
In other cases the negative verb is formed by adding an e to the base , and using the ordinary personal and tense suffixes .
The base seems to be used as a verbal noun .
Another verbal noun ends in ād and contains the neuter demonstrative pronoun .
The Dhīmāl dialect is spoken by a small tribe in the Darjeeling Terai .
No estimates of the number of speakers have been forwarded for the purposes of this Survey .
A full vocabulary and a grammatical sketch of the dialect have been published by Hodgson .
The same is the case with the list of Standard Words and Phrases on pp .
Hunter , W.W., A Comparative Dictionary of the Languages of India and High Asia .
The numeral e , one , is used as an indefinite article , and definiteness is indicated by means of demonstrative pronouns .
Gender is indicated by using different words or by prefixing dānkhā , dhāngāi , male ; mahani , bhundi , female , etc.
The plural is not marked when it appears from the context .
The subject of intransitive verbs and the object are not distinguished by any suffix .
Adjectives usually precede , but sometimes also follow the noun they qualify ; thus , ēlkā chan-galai , good children .
The first numerals are given in the list of words .
The following are the personal pronouns : The demonstrative pronouns are ī , this ; ū , that .
The demonstrative pronouns are inflected like personal pronouns ; thus , ī-ko , or yāng-ko , of this ; yēng , to this ; yāng-sho , from this .
All verbs are inflected in exactly the same way .
The usual verb substantive is jeng-li , to be .
The base alone is sometimes used as a present ; thus , nāni mhoikā-dinchā-tā hadē-kā , to-day jungle-to go-I , to-day I am going to the jungle .
The suffix of the past is hi ; thus , nā hadē-hi-nā , thou wentest .
An imperfect is formed by prefixing lāmpāng , formerly , to the present ; thus , kā lāmpāng khāng-khi-kā , I was wishing .
The suffix of the future is āng , which sometimes becomes ān before the suffix kā of the first person .
The simple base without any suffix is used as an imperative ; thus , chā eat ; mā lē , don ’ t come .
The usual verbal noun is formed by adding li ; thus , hadē-li , to go , in order to go .
A kind of passive can however be expressed by adding the verbs nēn , to find , and chā , to eat , to the base and conjugating throughout ; thus , yolla-sho dang-hai nēn-chā-hi-kā , brother-from beating found-ate-I , I was beaten by my brother .
The negative particle is a prefixed mā ; thus , kā mā khāng-khi-kā , I do not wish ; kā mā hān-kā , I am not going ; mā hodē , don ’ t go .
The usual order of words is subject , object , verb .
These forms throw light on Kōlāmī amd , which must be derived from avnd .
Nouns .
The case-suffixes are not always added in the specimen .
Note , however , the occasional use of a dative suffix ku , kūn ; thus , bāpku , to the father ; gaḍyākūn , to the servant .
The personal pronouns are .
In Bhīlī we find forms such as innen bālā , thy son , where the possessive pronoun agrees with the qualified noun in the same way as in Gōṇḍī .
Verbs .
In the third person singular neuter we also find andīn , it is .
The form is , however , perhaps a noun of agency one who is dead .
Finite verbs form their present tense from a participle ending in s , and the past from a form ending in t.The various tenses of the verb gōḷ , to beat , are given as follows .
In most of the preceding characteristics and in other important points the Bhīlī of Basim agrees with Kōlāmī , as will be seen from the version of the Parable of the Prodigal Son which follows .
Kanāshī is the dialect spoken in a glen within the Bias valley , containing only the village , called by outsiders Malāna and by the villagers themselves Mālānī .
The village of Malana is thus very isolated , and to this isolation doubtless is due the preservation of the ancient and curious dialect spoken there ’ .
The dialect was not separately returned at the last Census of 1901 .
I am indebted to Mr.G .C .L .Howell , Assistant Commissioner of Kulu , for two specimens and a list of Standard Words and Phrases in Kanāshī .
The materials have been noted down in Roman and vernacular characters .
Mr.Howell states that he cannot hear any aspirates in the dialect , but that his clerks say they can .
The same is the case with the palatal ny , for which the Romanized text has n .The dialect possesses semi-consonants in words such as tek ’ , great ; buratak ’ , comes ; duj ’ , to him , and so on .
Thus the suffix of the dative occurs as uj , uzh , and uz .
Tones and accent .
The accent is usually thrown as far back as possible .
The suffix of the dative is uj , the final sound of which is stated to be a semiconsonant .
The suffix of the ablative occurs as s , dz , and ts ; thus , K ultang-s , from Kulu ; korang-ngaz , from the rent ; ba-di- ts , from a father ; chandi ts o maṛshang-gan-di- ts , from good men .
Adjectives .
way by putting the compared noun in the ablative or the locative ; thus , du-ka bau du-ka ringz ( - ka ) ni ts lamas to , his brother his sister from tall is ; sab-ka-ni ts akli , all from wise ; sab-a tek ’ , all among great .
Higher numbers are counted in twenties , though the Aryan method of reckoning in tens is also commonly used by men , while the women stick to the other way .
Pronouns .
There are apparently no dual forms and no double forms of the plural of the first person , denoting the exclusive and inclusive plural .
Indefinite pronouns are formed from the same bases ; thus , hati , any one ; hasi , by any one ; chhigi , anything .
Relative pronouns are yang-s , by whom ; yang , whatever .
There are no certain instances of the use of suffixes to denote an object or to add a reflexive meaning .
The former is used when the indirect object is of the third person , the latter when it is of the first .
In the first person singular a k is added ; thus , shigu-ta-k , I die .
Forms such as tosh are also used as a respectful singular ; compare Kanāwᵃrī .
Periphrastic forms containing the verb substantive are royo-to , he lives ; raku-ta-to , he is grazing , and probably also bura-ch-to , he will come .
Forms such as hashig and hashik , became ; achig , arose , have already been mentioned under the head of present time .

Appendix A contains numerals , and Appendix B personal pronouns in Magar .
Some of the most usual case-suffixes are likewise Aryan .
Pronunciatioṇ Mãgarī possesses the vowels a , e , i , o , and u .
The vowels are sometimes marked as long and sometimes as short .
M , n , r , and l are frequently aspirated , and the same is , according to Mr.Beames , the case with all consonants in excited talk ; thus , ḍhānghonhe , I see , I see , instead of ḍāngone .
On the other hand , the dentals are said to have the same sound as the English dentals .
Article .
Nouns .
It is probably a demonstrative pronoun .
Case .
The suffix of the genitive is o or u ; thus , bay-o , of a father ; des-ũ , of a country .
In forms such as bhar-mi-kung , of a man , the final vowel has been accompanied by a nasalization .
Adjectives .
Numerals precede the word they qualify .
Indefinite pronouns are formed by adding the indefinite particle ra to interrogatives ; thus , su-ye-ra , by any one ; hi-ra , anything .
It is , however , combined with the relative participle , and not with the finite tenses of the verb .
Note finally the reflexive pronoun laho , own .
Verb substantive .
A compound present is formed by adding m-ne or mi-ne , i.e., the verb substantive and the suffix of the conjunctive participle .
Mr.Beames gives mo-ne , or , after consonants , o-ne , instead , and calls this form an aorist because it is used with reference to past , present , or future occurrences .
Mr.Beames also mentions a suffix lang or nang ; thus , nang-ke sāt-nang , I will strike you ; rākh-lang , I bring .
Nung-ne , went , and similar forms , probably also belong to the present time .
Verbal nouns and participles .
This form is sometimes also used as a verbal noun ; thus , harkha zāt-cha , to make merry ; ku-chi birin-chu : āle , whom-by sending may be ?
The conjunctive participle is formed by adding mü , or , after consonants , nu : ; thus , yā-mü , having given ; rākh-nü , having brought .
An adverbial participle , which also has the meaning of a conjunctive participle , is formed by adding the suffix nā or nāng ; thus , de-nā , saying ; rā-nāng , on coming .
Causative verb .
Some causatives are apparently formed by adding k ; thus , rā-ke , to come ; rāk-ke , to bring ; bilāk-nu , causing to put on , from bilh-ke , to put on .
The usual order of words is subject , object , verb .
This Paṭṭanī dialect is spoken in the Kadi division of Baroda , in Mahikantha including the outlying Parantij-cum Modasa sub-division of the Ahmedabad district and in the greater part of the state of Palanpur .
On the east it has the various Bhīl dialects of Mahikantha , and on the south it has the village dialect of Ahmedabad , with which it is closely connected .
Paṭṭaṇī possesses all the peculiarities of the village dialect of Ahmedabad , its only real difference being that it possesses these peculiarities in a higher degree , and exhibits them more regularly .
The vowel a is changed to ī in dīyā for dayā , compassion .
Such are hama or ham ã , now ; karyu for kary ũ , it was done ; nē or nē~ , the sign of the dative ; khātā~-tā~ , they ( masculine ) were eating .
Indeed so entirely identical are the sounds represented by the Gujarātī letters # , # , and # that they are 
Other examples of the pronunciation of these letters are sākᵃrī .
Very similarly , when the letter g is followed by ī , ē , or y , it is pronounced ( and written ) j .
There is the usual confusion of cerebral and dental letters .
The letters s and ś regularly become h .
I have not noted any instances in which h is dropped , but aspiration is lost in words like ēkᵃtu , for ēkᵃṭh ũ , in one place ; hātī , for hāthē , on the hand .
Nouns .
The agent-locative ends in ī , instead of ē .
Pronouns .
Verbs .
The Definite Present of the finite verb is thus conjugated .
The future , I shall strike , is thus conjugated , The Present and Past Parṭiciples are as in s tandard Gujarātī , with a few irregularities .
The following are the numbers of speakers : Further particulars and a list of authorities will be found under Banjōgī .
Concurrent vowels are occasionally contracted , thus ā-pān and ā-pā-in , his father , etc.
In Southern Chin according to Mr.Houghton , kl regularly corresponds to tl in Lushēi , and the occurrence of both in Pānkhū may be due to the double influence of the two former languages .
The prefix pa in the first numerals is generally written pha ; thus pha-kāt , one .
Concurrent consonants may be assimilated ; thus , khāk-ka for khāt-kā , one .
Consonants are sometimes doubled between vowels ; thus , kappā or kā-pā , my father ; kānnūng , back , i.e., kā-nūng , my back ; innā , in the house , etc.
Articles .
In the list of words the suffix kā in khāt-kā is once used alone as an indefinite article ; thus pā kā , a father .
Pā is the common male suffix , and nū the corresponding female one .
Another set of suffixes is ch.āl, male , and ( ā- ) pūi , female .
It is also possible to add the noun the gender of which is indicated as an adjective to some word meaning ‘ male ’ or ‘ female being ’ .
Number is only indicated when it does not appear from the context .
E only occurs in vok-e , the pigs , and is perhaps no plural suffix .
Ngei occurs as a plural suffix in Kōm , Hallām , Banjōgī , etc., and means ‘ many ’ , ‘ very ’ .
I cannot analyse the remaining plural suffix kup , which is used alone or together with ngei .
The Nominative and the Accusative do not take any suffix .
The suffix in is however often omitted , especially in the list of words .
noun ; thus , kā-pā sūa-pūi nāo , my father ’ s brother ’ s son , the son of my uncle .
It is not probable that tū is a real suffix of the genitive and it does not occur as such in any sentence .
Adjectives .
The suffix of comparison is nāk-ān or nāk-ā chūn ; thus , ā-chūa-pūi-pā ā-char-nū nāk-ān an-chāng , his brother his sister than tall , his brother is taller than his sister ; o-mā ( i.e., ā-mā ) nāk-ān ā-chā , that than good , better .
Numerals .
The suffix kā is probably the same as in jā-kā , many , all .
Ho is apparently a demonstrative pronoun ; thus , ā-ni nāo ho , his son that , ā-ni ho thin thoy-ā ān-tha^-rāo , he that tree under sitting-is .
Demonstrative pronouns .
The pronoun chū is added to other words in order to emphasise ; thus , kei-chū , I ; nang-ni-chū , you ; kā pā chū , my father ; ā-tsūm chū , his property .
Interrogative pronounṣ Ā-tū , who ?
The interrogative particle mēn may be added .
Indefinite pronouns .
Verbs .
These prefixes are often dropped , but this fact may be due to inadvertence .
Thus , kā and ā are occasionally used as plural prefixes .
240 the prefix of the second person singular is given as mē , probably a miswriting for nē , etc.
The suffix of the Present definite is given as roa or rāo , compare Lai leo .
The corresponding Imperfect seems to be formed with the suffix en ; thus , kei-mā ( n ) kā jel-en , I was beating .
The suffixes of the Past tenses are tā and roa ; thus , kā chūan-tā , I did ; ā ti-tā , he said ; kei-chū kā kal-roa , I went .
Another future suffix seems to be āt ; thus , kā-ti-āt , I shall die , I am dying ; kei-mā ā-jel-āt , me he strike will , I shall be struck .
Compare the Old Kuki negative māk , and Introduction , p .19 .
Both these forms seem to belong to the present definite or imperfect .
The mere root may be considered as a Relative participle in clauses such as ēi-ding ā-nāi-lo-hūn-in , to-eat he not-having time at , when he had nothing to eat .
A Noun of agency is formed by adding the suffix tū ; thus , la^-lo-tū , a cultivator ; kēl-kāl-tū , a goat tender , a shepherd ; mā-vāi-tū , one who wastes .
Compound verbs are formed by means of prefixes and by adding other words in order to modify the meaning .
Instead of ni-rot we find rūat ( compare Lushēi ruat ) in the corresponding passage , and ni is perhaps the pronominal prefix of the second person singular .
The Negative particle is lo ; thus ā-nāi-lo , he had not .
Name of the language .
The name Korwā does not therefore appear to have anything to do with that word , which in the west has the form kōṛ It is perhaps connected with names such as Kherwāṛ We do not , however , know anything about the original meaning of either of those words .
In the case of Manbhum this agrees with information kindly supplied by the Rev .
DialectṣThe language of the Korwās is not the same in all places .
Specimens of that more refined form of the language will be given below on pp .
There are no corresponding returns in the caste table , and it is therefore probable that the language figures are due to some misunderstanding .
Crooke , W., A Vocabulary of the Korwa Language .
They are , however , the only foundation for the remarks on Korwā grammar which follow .
The semi-consonants have only been marked in the Jashpur specimens , and even there in a very inconsistent manner .
Note also the insertion of a w in forms such as katā-waḍ-i-ā , he said to him ; the use of the infix n in words such as anamak ’ , thy ; kanalom , last year , etc.
Verbal tenses in the Jashpur specimens frequently end in ō ; thus , āyum-aḍ-ō , he heard ; but katā-waḍ-ā , he said ; katā-ter-ā-yō , he said .
Nouns .
Numerals .
Pronouns .
In the case of demonstrative pronouns we find the same forms beginning with m as in Asurī .
An initial y does not appear to belong to the Muṇḍā languages .
Verbs .
The indefinite future tense is regularly formed .
The usual present tense is formed as in Muṇḍārī .
The suffix tā in Jashpur sometimes also has the meaning of past time ; thus , doho-tā , was ; bol-tā , entered .
Such forms frequently have the meaning of a present ; thus , goj-yan-ā , I die ; im-yad-ā , he gives ; chalāo-en-ā , goes .
The suffix ket ’ , ken , etc., occurs in forms such as byāh-ked-e-ā , he has married her ; īdān-kī-ā , said ; yam-keṛ-ā , got ; surtā-ker-ā , he came to his senses ; goch ’ - ken-ā , he died ; vich ’ - ken-ā , he has come , and so forth .
The imperative is regular .
The noun of agency is formed as in Asurī .
The negative particle is mē in Jashpur , minē in Mirzapur , and menē or nē in Palamau .
A list of Standard Words and Phrases from Mirzapur will be found below on pp .
The remarks on Digāru grammar which follow are based on this sketch and on the list of words published by Mr.Needham .
The most usual prefixes are mā and nā , often abbreviated to m and n , perhaps corresponding to the prefixes ma and n which form nouns and adjectives in Kachin .
Nā is usually prefixed to nouns denoting relationship .
This nā is perhaps originally the possessive pronoun of the second person .
A prefix kā seems to occur in words such as kā-lō , field ; kā-rā , rain ; kā-chī , rat ; kā-nō-ā , dark ; kā-rō , quickly .
Gender is only apparent in the case of animate nouns .
Compare the male suffix wa in Kachin .
Other suffixes are rī~ , male , and krū , female ; thus , tāmyūm rī~ , a male monkey ; tāmyūm krū , a female monkey .
When it is necessary to distinguish the number of a noun , a numeral or some word meaning ‘ all , ’ ‘ many , ’ etc., is added .
The nominative and the accusative do not take any suffix .
Adjectives follow the noun they qualify .
There are no suffixes of the comparative .
They follow the noun they qualify .
The numbers 11-19 are formed by adding the numerals ‘ one , ’ ‘ two , ’ etc., to ‘ ten ; ’ thus , hālü , or hālong , khing , ten one , eleven ; hālu : sāng or halo ra-chong , thirteen , etc.
The numerals 20-90 are formed by prefixing ‘ two , ’ ‘ three , ’ etc., to hā-lāng , ten .
The plural is , according to Mr.Robinson , formed by adding long , before which hā becomes hing .
Compare the corresponding suffix lu in Miri and Daflā .
The possessive pronouns are the same as the personal ones .
The demonstrative pronouns are ē-chā or e-sā this , and wē-chā or hi-sā , that .
There are no relative pronouns .
It seems that they are usually formed after the pattern ‘ I saw a man , he has come , ’ instead of ‘ the man whom I saw has come ’ .
Verbs do not vary for gender , number , or person .
The verb dī , to sit , to be , is sometimes suffixed as a kind of auxiliary verb .
The suffixed mam in the last instance is an affirmative particle and no tense suffix .
The suffix of the Future is n-dē .
Compare the suffix na in Southern Kachin .
An imperative of the first person plural is formed by adding kē or gē ; thus , pō-kē or pō-gē , let us go ; dh ā~-kē or dh ā~-gē , let us eat ; yī-kē or yī-ge , let us stay .
The root alone is used as a verbal noun .
Bri-no may as well , in this instance , be considered as a compound verb .
Mr.Robinson mentions a suffix gē which is used in order to denote purpose .
It will be seen from this instance that the suffix gē is a suffix of the future , that tense being used to denote the purpose in Digāru as in other connected languages .
Bhē in hā~ tā-pē~ dh ā~-dī-bhē , I cooked rice eat-if , is perhaps the suffix of an adverbial participle .
They are perhaps formed by suffixing gō ( Needham ) or kwon ( Robinson ) .
Desideratives seem to be formed by adding no ; thus , according to Mr.Robinson , hā teku bri-no , I paddy to-buy-wish .
Potentiality is indicated by adding hēnē ( Needham ) or hanē ( Robinson ) .
The Negative particle is a suffixed im ( Needham ) or yem , yom ( Robinson ) .
Mr.Robinson states that lum is added in the negative future and in the potential mood .
Both forms are apparently future tenses , all Mr.Robinson ’ s instances of the potential mood being in the future .
The Interrogative particle is gē .
The interrogative particle seems to be dropped when the sentence contains an interrogative pronoun .
The usual order of words is subject , object , verb .
There is a tendency to aspirate consonants , as in mōṭhō , for mōṭö , great ; ēkhāḍī , for ēkāḍī , a certain one ; chhumō for chumō , kissed ; ā~ghē or ā~gē , before .
A final ē is often weakened to a , as in chha for chhē , he is ; na or nē , to ; ra or rē , the locative of rō , of .
The declension of nouns is very irregular .
Many nouns , even those ending in consonants , have an oblique form in ē .
The plural of nouns in ō or ā ends in ā or ē .
As an example of the agent case , we have ō-nē mēlyō , he sent .
For the dative-accusative we have the usual locatives of the genitive postpositions .
The suffix of the ablative is usually tī as in waḍhāḷ-paṇē-tī , by debauchery .
Rō has its oblique masculine rā , its feminine rī , and its locative ( agreeing with nouns in the locative and dative ) rē , as in Mārwāṛī .
The usual sign of the locative is mē , ma , or mā .
The sense of gender is very capricious .
Adjectives follow the Mārwāṛī rules .
For Demonstrative pronouns ( including the pronoun of the third person , we have ū , ō , he , that , they ; ō-nē , by him ( but ū kyō , he said ) ; ō-rō , his ; ō-rē , ō-na , to him ; ānu-rō or anu-rō , their .
Conjugation .
It will be observed that , as in some forms of colloquial Gujarātī , chha may be used for all persons and both numbers .
When used as an auxiliary it becomes simply tō , as in colloquial Gujarātī .
As for Finite verbs , the Infinitive , Present Participle , and Past Participle are as in Rājasthānī , viż , mārᵃnō , to strike ; mārᵃtō , striking ; māryō , struck .
The simple present is conjugated much like the corresponding tense in Gujarātī and Rājasthānī .
The present definite is also conjugated as in these languages , the auxiliary verb being added to the simple present , and not to the present participle .
Other examples are ( often with the sense of a future ) marūchhū , I die ; khāū-chha , we may eat ; hōū-chha , let us become .
The Past tense is as usual , except that this tense in the case of transitive verbs agrees with the subject .
In the former case , the auxiliary verb agrees with the subject .
The Future is mainly based on the h-future of Mārwāṛī .
It is conjugated as follows .
Irregular Past Participles are khādō , eaten ; kidō , done ; dinō or dēnō , given ; lābhō , got ; kyō , kēwō , or kēhō , said ; ryō , remained ; gyō or gō , gone .
A sort of continuous conjunctive participle is formed by adding tānī ( for thānē , having become , as we see from the Central Provinces specimens ) to the root , as in rē-tānī , while remaining ; dē-tānī , while giving .
The Rājasthānī idiom of employing kō-nī , at-all not , for the negative is very common .
The majority of the inhabitants of the Chamba State speak Aryan dialects .
T.Grahame Bailey has written a full account of the dialect which he proposes to call Chamba Lāhuḷī .
Articles .
Number .
The suffix of the genitive is u or ō , plural du ; thus , rhã-u , of a horse ; bā-ō , of a father ; mīū~ , of a man ( mī~ , man ) ; mīl-yō-du , of daughters .
Adjectives .
Other numerals are sē-īdī , eleven , sha-shrum , thirteen ; sā-pī , fourteen ; sang , fifteen ; sā-trūī , sixteen ; sā-nhī , seventeen ; sā-rē , eighteen , sos-kū , nineteen .
A .H .Francke informs me that there are also dual forms of the pronouns , and , moreover , both exclusive and inclusive forms of the dual and plural of the first person .
Demonstrative pronouns are di , this ; du , that , and nu , that ( compare nuar , there ; nu-rā , on that side , etc.) .
The interrogative pronouns can also be used as relatives ; thus , aũ ghārī chumh kachā pī , what time house near came , when he approached the house ; anyō māl gē-bī pīpā gē-bī raũ , how-much property me-to comes me-to give , give me the property that falls to me .
Forms such as tod tōī are also used in the plural .
Forms such as ra-mā-d , he gives , show that the third person singular is formed by adding the personal suffix directly to the participle ; compare also pī-pā , comes ; brā~ , lives .
Past time .
The termination of the third person is rī , plural ra , after s-sounds ; thus , khos-ī-rī , he was found ; khos-ī-re , they were found ; roshēshī-rī , he got angry .
The most common past tense is apparently formed by adding deg ( teg ) , etc., to the base or to a verbal noun ending in ā , pā , bā , mā , zā , ts ā , etc.
Deg is by origin a past tense of the base da , which is used as a verb substantive .
An l-suffix occurs in forms such as ī-leā , ī-lead , and ī-lī , he went ; thā-le-g , I heard , and so on .
Imperative .
Verbal nouns and participles .
The same suffix is apparently used to form relative participles and nouns of agency ; thus , kam-lhā-zā , work doer , servant ; khosā , found .
Compare the suffixes of the case of the agent and of the terminative .
It will be seen that the plural forms of the third person are dual by origin .
The same bases occur in the indefinite pronouns āsā-ne , anybody ; ūkhāng , anything .
Nouns .
There are three numbers , the singular , the dual , and the plural .
Numerals .
Pronouns .
The indefinite particle is sāng , also ; thus , āsā-sāng , anybody ; yõ-sāng , anything .
The suffix ān , i.e.
The negative with imperatives is na .
Nouns .
There are three numbers , the singular , the dual , and the plural .

I regret that up to the time of writing I have not succeeded in obtaining any specimens of this language .
Their language differs from village to village , but this is principally a matter of intonation and pronunciation .
Lhōtā is a distinct language from Āo , but is at the same time closely connected with it .
We may therefore class these Nāgā languages as a great tree with at least two boughs , one represented by Āo and Lhōtā , and the other by Angāmi , Rengmā , Kezhāmā , and Semā .
W.E., Outline Grammar of the Lhōtā Nāgā Language ; with a Vocabulary and Illustrative Sentences .
Lhōtā Nāgā , unlike Āo , abounds in aspirated consonants .
Tones play an important part in Lhōtā .
The voice always falls at the end of a sentence , and in double interrogatives , in which the verbal root is reduplicated , the first syllable of the interrogative verb is spoken on a much higher key than the rest of the sentence .
This prefix corresponds to the prefix ā which is met in Semā , Rengmā , and Mongsen Āo , and to the Kezhāmā e.The prefix e , corresponding to the te or t of Āo , is used before nouns , adjectives , and gerunds , has no formative significance , and may be assumed or thrown off at pleasure .
Examples of this prefix will be found below .
This corresponds to the Āo suffix er , and the Angāmi suffix u .
This suffix , which corresponds to the relative particle of Dravidian languages , is of frequent occurrence .
Mr.Witter gives the following excellent example of the way in which nouns , adjectives , and verbs are in their root forms indistinguishable from one another .
The force of the indefinite article is conveyed by suffixing the indefinite pronouns matsangā or ntsangā , a certain .
The numeral e-khā , one , is only used in counting , and not as an article .
More often , however , the relative particle wōchī , or wōchu : is suffixed .
These articles are only used when ambiguity would result from their absence .
For human relations , different words are used to indicate gender .
Number is only indicated when this is rendered necessary by the context .
Nouns of multitude are # so added to form the plural .
The syllable tō is frequently suffixed when two or more objects are spoken of in succession .
Case is indicated by postpositions .
The sign of the nominative , when it is the subject of a transitive verb , is nā .
This nā is evidently the sign of the case of the Agent , and the literal translation of the foregoing sentence is ‘ by your brother and my brother a tiger was slain ’ .
The suffix corresponds to the Kezhāmā nyi .
The accusative case takes no suffix .
This case is formed by the suffix nā , as in ā-nā ō-nung-nā shī e-phīā-tsang-cho , I slew him with a stone .
Ablative .
The suffixes are ī , in ; o or lo , on ; and we or wī , in the direction of , on , upon ; or other postpositions may be used .
When a noun is followed by an adjective in agreement with it , the postposition is added to the latter .
Adjectives .
The numerals will be found in the list of words .
The following ordinals are given by Mr.Witter : ovūngōchü , the one in front , first .
The Personal pronouns are Nom .
The Demonstrative pronouns are used for the third person .
The Demonstrative pronouns , both of which are used as pronouns of the third person , are , 1 .shī , hī , this , he ; shī tō ōnī , these two ; shīāng , shīā~ , shīānō , hīang , these , they .
The Interrogative pronouns are ō-chī , ō-chō , who ?
The force of the Relative pronoun is usually given by the relative suffix wōchī , etc., he who is .
Sometimes the interrogative pronoun is used as a relative , and is then followed by a demonstrative .
The Reflexive pronoun is mōchī or mōmō , self .
The ideas of time and mood are conveyed by prefixes and suffixes added to the root .
Present definite .
Same as second form of present , ā-nā tsō-ā-lā , I was eating .
Future .
Imperative .
Participles and Gerunds .
The same form sometimes has the power of an-adjective , i.e., participle , and sometimes that of a verbal noun , i.e., gerund .
The past conditional is formed with wō in the protasis , and kàtōlā in the apodosis .
Compound verbs .
There are also prefixes used with a similar result .
Negative forms are indicated by the prefix n or m , except in the imperative mood , where it is tī .
The Interrogative particles are ke and nung , which are attached to the verb .
Double interrogatives double the verbal root , and , in the past tense , take the termination ēlā .
Adjectives and articles usually follow the nouns they qualify .
Marāṭhī is the principal language of Berar and of the southern part of the Central Provinces .
Area in which spokeṇBeginning from the west this dialect covers the eastern part of Buldana , leaving the western border to Standard Marāṭhī .
The dialect is further spoken by scattered settlers in Raipur , Bilaspur , Nandgaon , Kawardha , and Bombay Town and Island .
Spoken abroad in It has been stated above that several minor dialects which were originally returned from Berar and the Central Provinces have proved to be local forms of the current Marāṭhī of the said districts .
Of these minor dialects the Marhēṭī of Balaghat has been slightly influenced by the neighbouring dialects of Eastern Hindī , and the Natakānī of Chanda has , in some points , accommodated itself to Telugu .
We thus arrive at the following total for the Marāṭhī of Berar and the Central Provinces : In connection with this form of speech it has been found convenient to deal with some broken dialects spoken in the Bastar State , Kanker , and Raipur , which have been largely influenced by the neighbouring Marāṭhī .
GrammaṛThe Marāṭhī spoken in Berar and the Central Provinces is closely related to the form which that language assumes in the Dekhan .
Long vowels , and especially final ones , are very frequently shortened ; thus , mī and mi , I ; māhi bāyᵃkō , my wife ; māhā and mahā , my .
As in the Konkan , an a is very commonly used where the Dekhan form of the language has an ē , especially in the termination ē~ of neuter bases , in the suffix nē~ of the instrumental , and in the future .
In some rustic dialects this short final a is occasionally dropped altogether ; thus , tyān , by him , in the so-called Dhanᵃgarī and Gōvārī of Chhindwara .
The cerebral ḍ , when preceded by a vowel , is pronounced as an r .in the so-called Māhārī of Chhindwara .
Thus , in the so-called Dzhāṛpī and Kōshṭī of Ellichpur we find forms such as ghōḷā , a horse , and in the dialect of the Kuṇᵃbīs of Akola d.is substituted for l .in words such as dzavaḍ , near .
All these facts can only be explained on the assumption that the cerebral l .has a sound which is very near to that of a cerebral ṛ , and that the cerebral d.after vowels assumes the same sound .
Nouns .
Mānᵃsa , men , which is a neuter plural , is frequently combined with an adjective in the masculine gender ; thus , tsāṅgᵃlē mānᵃsa , good men , and so on .
Pronouns .
The demonstrative pronoun tō , that , is , in most respects , inflected as in the Dekhan .
has an ablative kāvhun or kāhun , why ?
is a compound meaning ‘ what having said ?’ Verbs .
The verb substantive is , with the above exceptions , regular .
From the root hō is formed mī vhay , I am , etc.
In the past tense vha is interchangeable with hō ; thus , tū hōtā or vhatā , thou wast .
The present tense of finite verbs is often formed as in the Dekhan ; thus , mī karᵃtō , I do ; tū karᵃtō ( s ) , thou dost ; tē karᵃtāt , they do .
Frequently , however , the second and third persons singular and the third person plural are formed in the same way as in the verb substantive , in which case the verb does not change for gender ; thus , tu rāhᵃtē ( s ) , thou livest ; tō yētē , he comes ; tō karᵃtyē , he does ; tē dzātēt , they go .
In Berar a is substituted for ē in the terminations of the second person singular and the third person plural ; thus , tū mārᵃta , thou strikest ; tē mārᵃtat , they strike .
In the imperative we may note forms such as dzāy , go ; khāy , eat ( Berar ) ; pāhya , see .
The habitual past is often used as an ordinary past .
The first person singular ends in ō in the only instance which occurs in the materials available ; thus , mī nidzō , I used to sleep .
The past tense is formed as in the Dekhan ; thus , myā mārᵃla , I struck ; tyā mārᵃla , thou struckest .
The third person singular of transitive verbs sometimes ends in an ; thus , dhāḍᵃlan , sent .
Such forms occur in the rustic dialects of Ellichpur , Chhindwara , and Bhandara .
The past tense of transitive verbs is used in the same way as in the Dekhan , the subject being put in the case of the agent , and the verb agreeing with the object in gender and number or being put in the neuter singular .
In some rustic dialects in Chhindwara , Bhandara , and Balaghat , however , the influence of the neighbouring dialects of Eastern Hindī has caused the passive and impersonal constructions to be frequently superse.dedby the active one , and we find forms such as mī pāp kēlō , I sinned .
In the future we must note forms such as mī asal , I shall be ; tū mārᵃsīn , thou wilt strike ; tē mārᵃtīn , they will strike .
In the dialect of the Kuṇᵃbīs of Akola we find a form tumhī mārᵃsān , instead of mārāl , you will strike .
Note also forms such as pāhādzōs , thou wilt see , which are properly a future imperative .
The verbal noun is formed as in the Dekhan .
The base alone seems to be used as a verbal noun , with oblique forms ending in yā , ā , and āy .
On the whole , however , grammar and vocabulary are the same as in the form of Marāṭhī current in the Dekhan .
The principal language of the whole district has been returned as Varhāḍī and closely agrees with the form of Marāṭhī described in the preceding pages .
The estimated figures for the two dialects are as follows .
The total number of speakers in Akola has been estimated at 465 , 600 , and there remain thus 4,000 regarding whom we are unable to tell to which of the two dialects they belong .
To this total must be added 1,000 individuals who have been returned as speaking Nāgpurī , and the weavers and potters who have been reported to speak separate dialects .
The two specimens which follow illustrate the so-called Brāhmaṇī dialect .
The only points which need be noted are the use of the dative suffix lā and the frequency with which ya is substituted for i and ē , i.e.
Nīmāḍī is not the only language of Nīmāwaṛ .
There are hence two distinct tracts in which Nīmāḍī is spoken , but in both the language is practically the same .
Nīmāḍī is really a form of the Mālvī dialect of Rājasthānī , but it has such marked peculiarities of its own that it must be considered separately .
It has fallen under the influence of the neighbouring Gujarātī and Bhīl languages , and also of the Khāndēśī which lies to its south .
This runs through the entire grammar .
Thus the sign of the agent case is na , not nē , and of the locative ma , not mē~ .
Nīmāḍī is not fond of nasal sounds , and frequently drops them .
As in Mālvī and Khāndēśī , aspiration is often dropped , as in hāt , not hāth , a hand ; bhūkō , for bhūkhō , hungry .
The letters l and n are interchangeable as in līm and nīm , tree .
In the neighbouring Bhīl languages , both j and ch are commonly pronounced as s.In Nīmāḍī , ch seems to be pronounced according to its proper sound , but j is often interchanged with it .
In the specimens which come from Bhopawar such forms are always written with j .
The letter jh is often pronounced as a z , as in the Marāṭhī of Berar , and as in some forms of Khāndēśī .
In the declension of nouns , the common form in ē , which in Rājasthānī is used sometimes for the agent and sometimes for the locative , appears in Nīmāḍī as ending in a .
Strong masculine tadbhavas in ō , form their oblique form in ā , as in Mālvī .
To form the plural the termination nā is added to the oblique form singular .
The case postpositions are as follows .
Agent , na .
Accusative-dative , ka .
Instrumental-ablative , sī , sū .
Genitive , kō , ( kā , kī ) .
Locative , ma .
We occasionally find the Rājasthānī kā , and the Bundēlī khē ( under the form of kha ) used for the Accusative-dative .
The genitive postposition kō is used with a singular masculine noun in the direct orm , and kā with a masculine noun in the oblique form .
Kī is used with feminine nouns .
In two instances I have noted kā used to agree with feminine nouns .
Yē , this ; oblique inā or ē .Wō , he , that ; oblique unā , wō , ō , wa ; Pl .
wō ; oblique uṇ .
Jō , who ( singular and plural ) ; jē-kō , of whom ; oblique singular jē .
The influence of the Bhīl dialects and of Khāndēśī is most evident in the conjugation of the Nīmāḍī verb .
The present tense of the verb substantive is chhē , which ( like the Khāndēśī sē ) does not change for number or person .
The past tense of the verb substantive is thō ( thā , thī ) , as in Mālvī .
When used as an auxiliary verb chhē drops the final ē and its aspiration , and becomes ch , which in its turn ( especially in Bhopawar ) often bccomes j .
We thus get the following form of the present of mārᵃṇū , to strike .
Khāndēśī itself usually takes a simple s in the present , not sē .
The Pārᵃdhī Bhīl dialect uses ch like Nīmāḍī .
The future ( as in Gujarātī ) has s for its characteristic letter , and is conjugated as follows .
Sometimes we find the true Mālvī future formed by adding an unchangeable gā .
The infinitive ends in ṇū , thus , mārᵃṇū , to strike ; when used as a participle future passive , its subject is put in the case of the agent .
Thus , apaṇ-na anand manāwᵃṇū nī khūsī hōṇū , joy was meet to be celebrated and happiness was meet to be ( note that the participle is masculine although agreeing with a feminine noun ) by us .
The oblique form of the infinitive ends in ṇa , thus , mārᵃṇa-kō , of beating .
Its language is a recognised dialect of Gaṛhwālī , known as the Tehrī dialect , and also by people of Garhwal and Almora , as “ Gaṅgāpāriyā ” or the language of the country beyond the Ganges .
Immediately to the west of the Tehri State lies the Jaunsār-Bāwar tract of the District of Dehra Dun , the language of which is the Western Pahāṛī Jaunsārī .
It is unnecessary to give a complete sketch of the grammar of Tehrī Gaṛhwālī .
The locative postpositions are used after verbs of saying , like the Standard mā .
Substantives and adjectives make their oblique forms as in the Standard .
The plural oblique terminations are au and ū , both of which are frequently nasalized .
Adjectives follow the same rules as in the Standard .
Pronouns closely follow the Standard .
The usual oblique form of tū , thou , is twai , as in twai-na ( ag .
Similarly , the agent singular of maĩ , I , is mai-na or maĩ-na .
For yō , this , he , and wō , that , he , we have : The Reflexive Pronoun is āphū , self ; genitive apṇō .
The Relative and Correlative Pronouns are .
The Interrogative Pronouns are kō ( declined like jō ) , who ?
The Indefinite Pronouns are kuī ( obl .
The Verbs Substantive are .
Chha may also be used for any person , as in tū ab marna tyār chha , thou art ready to die .
The usual past is thayō , was ; plural thayā ; fem .
Finite Verb .
The Present Participle is formed as in the Standard , either with dō or ṇū ( nū ) .
The Past Participle also follows the Standard , ending in ē , yō , and yū~ , with oblique forms in ē , yā and yā~ .
As examples of the Future Passive Participle , we have in the second specimen ham-na kanū raṇa ( for rahṇa ) khāṇa , how is it to be dwelt , to be eaten , by us ?
The Imperative follows the Standard .
The Old Present occurs in hōū~ , I may be ; māraũ , I may strike ; jēū~ , let us eat ; mānaũ , let us celebrate .
The Present has two forms as in the Standard .
The first is a present definite , mārdō chhaũ , I am striking .
In the Parable we have a weak form of the Present Participle in dēnda thayō , ( no one ) was giving .
For the Future we have in the masculine : Similarly , jaulō , I will go ; bōllō , I will say ; rahlī ( fem .
The Past Tenses closely follow the Standard .
For intransitive verbs we have : rāyō , I remained ; chalyō , I went ; ghūmyō ( sentence 224 ) , I walked about , and also : Similarly , hōyē , he became ( 225 ) ; lagena , they began ; lyāyena , they brought ; ṭūṭena , they broke ( intransitive ) .
Note that sakī is treated as transitive .
The negative is ni .
The seat of the Rengmās is in the Năga Hills to the south of the Lhōtāṣ Unlike the latter , whose speech is connected with Āo , and belongs to the Central Sub-Group of Nāgā Languages , Rengmā belongs to the Western Sub-Group , and must be classed with Angāmi , Semā , and Kezhāmā .
The members of the tribe call themselves Unzâ , but about half speak what they call the Mâyi Language , and the others what they call the Unzâ .
The Rengmā Nāgās are closely allied to the Semāṣ In Themokedima , the largest village of the tribe , the people are bi-lingual , i.e., they all talk Semā ( Simi ) as well as their own language , and most of the village songs are sung in that tongue , and not in Rengmā .
A version of the Parable of the Prodigal Son and a list of words in this language have been obtained with considerable difficulty by the Deputy Commissioner of the Năga Hills .
So far as I have been able to collate the facts , I here give the principal peculiarities of Rengmā grammar .
The Prefixes ke , ka and the are used much as in Angāmi .
The prefix ā is , as in Semā , of very common occurrence .
There is a Suffix nyu or nyu : corresponding to the Angāmi mā or mi .
For the definite article , the prefix ā is used as shown above .
For the indefinite article , the numeral mē , one , is employed .
The only suffixes of gender which I have been able to identify are tsē for the masculine , and lē for the feminine .
The usual suffix of the plural seems to be dang , as in metu tsē-dang bulls .
The Nominative takes the suffix lē , much like the Āo e.This suffix is used before both transitive and intransitive verbs .
The termination , as in Āo , is omitted when no ambiguity will ensue .
The relative particle , corresponding to the Angāmi u is apparently gü , as in ā-nche-gü , the younger ; peshi-gü , the elder .
The Accusative takes no termination , as in ā-hong ā-pui un-kē-lā-lē , wasted the whole of his property .
The Genitive takes no termination , and precedes the noun that governs it , as in the-bd chu , swine ’ s food .
Other suffixes of case are kā or ki , to ; hu , to ; ki , from ; kā , in ; nyü , in ; ghenyü , from ; zanho , with .
Adjectives follow the nouns they qualify , and in that case , case- and number-suffixes are added to them , and not to the noun , as in reni kaje-ki , to a far country .
They take the prefix ke as in Angāmi , thus , ke-gwā , good .
It will have been noticed how economical Rengmā is in the use of the suffixes of case , the same syllable being used to illustrate such widely different ideas as ‘ to ’ and ‘ from ’ .
This is also strikingly true with the personal pronouns , those of the first and third persons being identical in form .
It is possible that in such cases the two words which are the same in appearance are distinguished by being pronounced with different tones , but no information is available on this point .
The following are the forms of the personal pronouns which I have noted : First person .
The list of words gives the plural as ā-pwi , aghu-nē , agun , hagha-lē .
The nē of the second form and the n of the third , may be corruptions of the Nominative suffix lē , or nē and n may be contracted forms of nyo .
The syllable ā is used as a pronominal prefix , meaning my , me , to me .
The - nyi in apürenyi is possibly the same as the suffix nyu .
Other cases are ā-kā , to him ; and ā common as a prefix , as in ā-pfü , his father ; ā-khu-lo-ho , seeing him .
For the plural the list of words gives apürenyi , and also haghu-nē .
As in Angāmi , the suffixes of the present and of the past tenses are the same , and the meaning of the verb must be concluded from the context .
The most common verb substantive is bi-nē , is or was .
As in other connected languages , the verbal suffixes can be added to substantives , adjectives , etc., as in u ’ - hong-nē , is thy property .
In the case of other verbs , the most usual suffix of the present is lē or nē as in vü-lē , beats ; tē-bi-nē is making .
In tē-bi-nyong , was doing , nyong apparently gives a continuative or durative sense .
An example of the simplest form of a past tense is zō-lē , said .
In un-kē-lā-lē , wasted , and gü-rā-lē , came back , lā and rā are infixes modifying the root-meaning , and not tense-signs .
Other forms translated as past tenses are pfsü-lā-tà , gave ; zō-yā , said ; ā-zō-hā-shi , ordered ; zō-ni-shi-lē , and zō-ni-shi , said .
The simplest form of the future is vü-ti , will strike .
The root gu : signifies ‘ go , ’ and gwā means ‘ good ’ .
As in Kezhāmā , the imperative ends sometimes in tà , and sometimes in lo .
Possibly it is only incorrect for the durative suffix nyong .
The causative particle , corresponding to the Angāmi bu is no , as in ā-pui-no ā-kanü-ti-lē , let us all be merry .
As an example of a desiderative verb , we may quote tē-bi-sü-bi-nē , wished to eat .
The negative particle is mo as in ā-tsü-mu-ho , not giving to him , here the mo is changed to mu , probably a false spelling ; ke-mo-tē-lā-si-lē and ke-mo-tē-lā-lē , did not , the root being tē , do ; sā-ri-mo-lē , broke-not ; ā-pfsü-mo-lē , did not give to me .
The Kāgate dialect of Tibetan is closely related to the so-called Sharpa and to the Tibetan of Sikkim .
The spelling of the specimens does not correctly reflect the actual pronunciation of the dialect .
Compare tin , classical Tibetan bdun , seven ; song and sing , the suffix of past time ; su and si , who ?
The letter e apparently also represents the sounds of a : in German ‘ Bär ’ and of o : in German ‘ bös ’ ; compare ne , Lhasa dialect nä , from ; te , Lhasa dialect dö , to sit , etc.
With regard to consonants it should be noted that the sounds j , dz , z , and zh are not correctly distinguished in the specimens .
The intermediate form , with an aspirated hard initial , occurs in phu , son .
On the other hand , hard initials are occasionally softened when preceded by vowels or nasals in compound words ; thus , tham-je , classical thams-chad , all .
With regard to final consonants g is usually changed to k , and b to p ; thus , chik , one ; phak , swine ; lep , arrive .
Final d is dropped and the preceding vowel is modified so that a becomes e ( i.e., probably a : ) , o becomes e , o , or oe , i.e., probably ö , etc.
Final n seems to exercise a similar influence on a preceding vowel .
Compare the suffix of the present participle ken or kin , Ladakhī mkhan .
A preceding vowel is modified , and probably lengthened ; thus , le , i.e., lā : , classical las , from ; nyī , classical gnyis , two .
In compound consonants containing a subscribed y as second component in classical Tibetan , this y is dropped before i and e ; thus , khi , classical khyi , dog ; pe , classical byed , do .
In other compounds the first consonant is dropped ; thus , lang , classical glang , bull ; lep , classical sleb , arrive ; kang-ba , classical rkang-ba , foot ; ta , classical rta , horse ; che , classical lche , tongue ; ke , classical skad , sound ; tong-bu , classical sdong-po , tree ; nang , classical gnang , give ; ngul , classical dngul , silver ; tin , i.e., tün , classical bdun , seven , and so forth .
Articles .
The numeral chik , one , is used as an indefinite , and the demonstrative pronoun di , this , as a definite article ; thus , mi chik , a man ; angsha-di , the share .
Nouns Gender .
Gender is distinguished by using different words or by adding qualifying affixes ; thus , no , brother ; nu-mu , sister : pu , son ; po-mo , daughter : ta-bu , horse ; ta-mu , mare .
Number .
The usual suffix of the plural is kya ; thus , aba-kya , fathers ; compare cha in Ḍänjong-kä .
Case .
The suffix of the genitive is i , ki , or gi after vowels , and i or ki after consonants .
The same form is also used as a case of the agent .
The definite article is often added in the genitive ; thus , aba chik-i-di , of a father .
Di is used alone as a genitive suffix in po-mu-di , of daughters .
Other cases are formed by adding suffixes such as la , in , to ; sa-le , from the place of , from ; minji , minjik , min-zi , min-zik , from ; dung-la , before , etc.
Adjectives .
Adjectives sometimes precede and sometimes follow the noun they qualify .
The particle of comparison is the Naipālī bhanda ; thus , kho-i a-zi bhanda no rim-bu-du , his sister than brother tall-is , his brother is taller than his sister .
Pronouns .
The following are the personal pronouns : The pronouns are inflected like nouns .
Other pronouns are di , this ; o and o-di , that ; su , who ?
Verbs .
The usual bases of the verb substantive are e and du .
In the past tense we find woe .
Finite verb .
The verb is still virtually a noun .
The subject of transitive verbs is put in the case of the agent , and the plural suffix kya can be added .
Present time .
A present is formed by adding yin to a participle ending in ka , pa , etc.
A compound present is formed by adding gu or ku , or , after vowels , u , and the verb substantive ; thus , chho-u-du , he is feeding ; kho-i rob-ku-du , he strikes ; te-ku-e , he lives ; ong-gu du-ba , he is coming .
Du-ba , is , in the last instance contains the usual suffix of the participle ; compare also ye-ba , they are .
To in rob-to , they strike , is probably the copula du .
Past time .
The participle ending in ba or pa is commonly also used as a past tense , especially in the second person ; thus , nyo-ba , I brought , thou broughtest ; kal-pa , wentest ; se-pa , killedest .
The most common past tense is formed by adding song , or , usually , sing , ( i.e., probably süng ) ; thus , gal-song and kal-sing , he went .
The common present is also used as a past ; thus , e-kin , i.e.
Future .
The present is also used as a future ; thus , don , I will go ; lap-ken , I will say ; ong-do , I shall be .
Imperative .
As in classical Tibetan , an a is often changed to o in the imperative ; thus , song , go ; so , eat ; long , stand .
The unaltered base is used in forms such as shi , die ; do , go ; ter , give .
Sometimes we find suffixes added such as kong , tong , dung , and ter ; thus , rob-kong ( i.e.
Verbal nouns and participles .
The most common verbal noun is formed by adding che , or , after vowels , ze ; thus , lap-che , to say ; do-ze , to go .
A suffix a occurs in charai-te-ya-la , in order to feed .
Relative participles are formed by adding ken or gen and ba .
The interrogative pronoun kan-di , which ?
Adverbial participles are formed by adding postpositions to the base ; thus , lap-na , saying-in , if you say ; ong-a-te-su , arriving-after , when he came .
Conjunctive participles are formed by adding di , ti , or di-ma-rang ; thus , rob-sing-di , having beaten ; kal-di-ma-rang , having gone .
Ma-rang is a postposition which governs the genitive .
It is therefore also added to the genitive of the base ; thus , sing-i-ma-rang , having been .
Negative particle .
The negative particle is a prefixed me or ma ; thus , kal-di me-ken , going not-were , did not go ; me-ter-ekin , not-giving-was , did not give ; ma-nyin , 
It will be seen that mat sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the verb .
Ahīrwāṭī , also called Hīrwāṭī and Ahīrwāl ( or the language of the Ahīr country ) is spoken in the west of the district of Gurgaon ( including the state of Pataudi ) .
Further north we have the Bāṅgarū dialect of Western Hindī , and the Ahīrwāṭī of Delhi and Rohtak , is much mixed with this dialect .
To the east of Ahīrwāṭī , in the central part of Gurgaon , and also south of Gurgaon , in the state of Alwar , the language is Mēwātī , of which Ahīrwāṭī is merely a variety .
Here , except in the north of the tract , where Bāṅgarū is spoken , the language is also Ahīrwāṭī .
The language of Narnaul of Patiala is also Ahīrwātī , but , as may be expected , it is much mixed with the surrounding dialects .
We thus see that Ahīrwāṭī represents the connecting link between Mēwātī and three other dialects , Bāṅgarū , Bāgṛī , and Shēkhāwāṭī .
Although it has one striking peculiarity , which appears all over the area which it occupies , I allude to the form taken by the verb substantive , it has in other respects various local varieties due to the influence of the neighbouring dialects .
Its backbone is , however , throughout Mēwātī , and it can only be classed as a form of that dialect of Rājasthānī .
speaking an Ahīr dialect .
The dialect of Rājasthānī spoken in Malwa is usually called Mālvī ( distinct from the Mālwaī dialect of Pañjābī ) , but is also called Ahīrī ; and that curious form of Gujarātī , which is half a Bhīl dialect , and which is generally known as Khāndēśī , also bears the name of Ahīrāṇī .
Nay more , between Khandesh and the Ahīrwāṭī country of Gurgaon there lies the wild hilly territory occupied by the Bhīls , whose language is nearly allied to that of Khandesh , and it is not impossible that , according to known phonetic rules , the word Bhilla or Bhīl should be explained as an old corruption of the word Ābhīra .
All these colonies of Ahīrs who have been described as possessing languages of their own , have been separated so widely , and for so many centuries , that it is not reasonable to expect that at the present day they should be found using the same form of speech , nor is this the case .
The most important of these is the use of the word sū~ to mean ‘ I am ’ which is typical of Ahīrwāṭī and its connected dialects , and is also common in Khāndēśī .
Literature , authoritieṣI know of no works written in Ahīrw#ṭī , and of no previous account of their language .
Grammar .
In its grammar Ahīrwāṭī differs but little from Mēwātī .
It is the stepping stone between that dialect and the Bāṅgarū dialect of Western Hindī spoken in Delhi , Rohtak , East Hissar , and Karnal .
In south Rohtak and in the Ḍābar tract of Delhi as we know , the language is actually Ahīrwāṭī .
I take the Ahīrwāṭī of Gurgaon as the standard .
The nominative of strong masculine nouns of the a base ends in ō , with an oblique singular in ā , thus agreeing with Mēwātī as against Bāṅgarū which has ā , with an oblique ē .
The same rule is followed in adjectives and in the suffixes of the genitive , it 
being understood that when they agree with nouns in the locative , they , as usual in Rājasthānī , end in ē , not ā .
Nouns of this class form the locative singular in ē or ai , as ghōṛē , or ghōṛai , in a horse .
Masculine nouns ending in consonants form the locative in ī , as in gharī , in a house The usual suffix of the dative is nai or nē~ , and the same suffix is also used for the case of the agent .
The genitive suffix is kō , as in Mēwātī .
The agent case is regularly used before the future passive participle , which is the same in form as the infinitive , as in tū-nē~ karᵃṇō thō , it was to be done by thee .
Note that the locative of the genitive is often used for the dative , e.g.
As usual , there are occasional instances of a neuter gender , as in dīṇū~ , that which is to be given .
The personal pronouns are as in Mēwātī .
Note the use of nē~ to form the agent case of these pronouns .
‘ Own ’ is apᵃṇū or apᵃnō , masculine oblique apᵃṇā .
The demonstrative pronouns are yō or yoh ( feminine yā ) , this , oblique singular aĩh or ãh , oblique plural in , often ased in the sense of the singular ; and wō or woh ( feminine wā , that ) , oblique singular waĩh or wãh or ū~ , oblique plural un , also often used as a singular .
As usual the relative pronoun is often employed in the sense of a demonstrative .
In other respects , the pronouns follow Mēwātī .
Probably the oblique singular of jō and kaun .
In verbs , the only thing to note is the verb substantive .
In the present this is : The past is thō , was , feminine thī , masculine plural thā .
The saĩ of the second plural present is borrowed from Bāgṛī .
The syllable gō is someṭimes added to the present , like the gā of Panjābī .
Thus , sai-gō , he is , corresponding to the Panjābī hai-gā In other respects verbs are conjugated as in Mēwātī .
Elsewhere they are gradually being Hinduized , and there is , at the same time , a distinct tendency among them to abandon their old dialect in favour of Khas .

Appendix A contains numerals in Gurung , etc.
Hunter , W.W., A Comparative Dictionary of the Languages of India and High Asia .
In vocabulary and phonetical system , and also in grammatical principles , Gurung is more closely related to Tibetan than are most Himalayan languages .
It is often difficult to decide whether a vowel is long or short , the spelling of the specimens being inconsistent .
It seems probable that Gurung in this respect agrees with Central Tibetan .
The consonantal system is apparently nearly the same as in Aryan dialects such as Hindī .
The aspirated soft consonants have apparently developed from older unaspirated sounds .
The final consonants of classical Tibetan have usually been dropped .
There are several compound consonants such as ghr , kr ; bhr , pr ; ghl , kl ; bhl , pl ; mr ; mn , and so on .
Tones and accent are probably the same as in other Nepal languages .
The numeral ghrī , one , is used as an indefinite article ; thus , mhī ghrī , a man .
The prefix a : is common before nouns of relationship .
The natural gender is distinguished by using different words or else by adding suffixes such as bokya , dho , dārhyā , male ; mama , me , murli , female .
There are two numbers , the singular and the plural .
The plural is not marked when it appears from the context .
Forms such as kõ-ye , clothes ; ma-ye , kisses , perhaps contain another plural suffix ye .
The subject of intransitive verbs and the object are not distinguished by adding any separate suffix .
The subject of transitive verbs is put in the case of the agent , which is formed by adding a suffix ji or di ; thus , ā-ba-di bī-dī , the father said ; ki-ji hoā-ji , thou struckest .
This suffix is sometimes also written de , and in that case it looks like the postposition de~ or de , classical Tibetan dang , with which , in its turn , is sometimes written di .
The initial d of the suffix of the agent is often pronounced as a th .
In chhu-ba-si , with ropes , the instrument has been indicated by adding a suffix si .
The suffix of the dative is lā-di or lāi ; thus , ā-ba-lādi , to a father .
Such forms are sometimes also used to denote the object of transitive verbs ; thus , cha-e jha-lā-di nga-di dhon-di , his son-to me-by struck , I have beaten his son .
The usual suffix of the genitive is e or ye ; thus , dhĩ-ye , of the house .
An a preceding the genitive suffix is often dropped ; thus ṭi-be ghlo-ri , living-of place-in , in the place where he stayed .
Another genitive suffix is la ; thus , ā-ba-mae-la , of fathers .
It is probably originally a dative suffix ; compare chiti-la , to senses .
The usual terminative-locative suffix is , however , rī or re ; thus , mno-rī , in the field , to the field .
The suffix na in forms such as pho-de-pho-de-na , with hunger ; rhe-gũ-na , from a distance ; saba-na , safely , is probably an ablative suffix .
Other relations are indicated by means of postpositions .
Adjectives usually follow the noun they qualify , or precede it in the genitive ; thus , mhi sa-ba , a good man ; the-be anikāl , a heavy famine .
Adjectives usually take the suffix ba ; thus , sa-ba , good ; sim-ba , cold ; kro-ba , hot ; mī-va , ripe .
The particle of comparison is bhandā ; thus , cha-ma-e ring bhandā cha-ma-e ā-lī nu-ba mu-lā , his sister than his brother tall is , his brother is taller than his sister .
The first numerals are given in the list of words .
They follow the word they qualify .
Higher numbers are counted in tens ; thus , bhlī-chyu , forty ; ṭu-chyu , sixty ; nī-chyu , seventy ; bhre-chyu , eighty ; ku-chyu , ninety .
The following are the personal pronouns : 
The final n in some of the forms just quoted is probably an intensifying particle .
Reflexive pronouns are khi-ye , own ; thama , thama-ye , thame , own .
Demonstrative pronouns are chu , this ; cha , that .
Interrogative pronouns are khae-pa-chā , who ?
The indefinite pronouns are formed from the same bases ; thus , khae-ba-de , by anybody ; tayī , anything , and , according to Hodgson , also sū-yāng , anybody ; ta-yāng , anything .
The two last mentioned pronouns contain an indefinite particle yā or yāng .
The conjugation of verbs is relatively simple .
There is no change for person or number , and the verb is , on the whole , still virtually a noun .
The most common verb substantive is mu .
Another base na is used in form such as tõ-si na-bu , am , art , or is , beating .
A third base is ta or tu in ta-di , is ; tũ-di , am ; tab-mu , shall be ; nga lāla tum-mu , I should be , and so forth .
The verb substantive is , to some extent , used in the conjugation of finite verbs .
The base alone is used as a present tense ; thus , nha-me jaga-di tõ , you strike .
M or ma , i.e., probably the verb substantive mu , is , however .
Forms such as chha-se-m , he is grazing ; ti-si-m , he lives ; kha-si-m , he comes , are formed by adding the same m to the conjunctive participle .
The suffix lā in mu-lā , is , was , is probably a general assertive suffix , and is not restricted with regard to time .
The suffix lā or lā~ is often used with the meaning of a past ; thus , nga hyā-lā , I went ; kha-lā~ , he came .
The suffix bā in la-bā , madest , is properly the suffix of a participle .
The most characteristic suffix of the past is ji or di ; thus , hoā-ji , went ; bī-di , said .
Forms such as la-sem , did ; ā-ngwe-sem , I did not transgress , seem to contain the conjunctive participle ending in si and the verb substantive .
The suffix of the future is mu , or ma , i.e., probably the verb substantive ; thus , ngai to-mu , I shall strike ; khi-ji hoā-ma , thou wilt strike .
The base alone is often used as an imperative .
A very common suffix is du , which often occurs in an abbreviated form d or t ; thus , cha-du , eat ; si-d , die ; rā-t , stand .
A verbal noun is formed by adding the suffix bā ; thus , nācha la-bā , dance making , dancing ; chha-ba-rī , in order to graze .
Forms such as cha-lā , to eat ; plī~-la , to fill , probably contain the same suffix as we have found in use in the formation of the tenses , or else la is a dative suffix .
The verbal noun ending in bā is also used as a relative participle , in which case it usually precedes the qualified noun in the genitive ; thus , dukha ta-be bela-ri , distress befalling time-at , at the time when distress befell him ; jāgīr cha-be mhi , wages eating man , servant .
The same participle is also used in such relative clauses as are introduced by an interrogative pronoun ; thus , nga-la to mu-ba , me-to what being , all that is mine .
The form ending in ba is sometimes also used with the meaning of a conjunctive participle ; thus , bī-ba , having said .
Another conjunctive participle is formed by adding the postposition mā to a verbal noun which is identical with the base ; thus , bī-mā , on saying , having said .
The tense bases are also used as participles ; thus , ti-sim mu-lā , is sitting ; sī-la , dead .
There is no passive voice .
It is formed by aspirating the initial consonant ; thus , cha-ba , to eat ; chha-ba , to feed .
The negative particle is a prefixed ā ; thus , ā-hyā , he did not go ; ā-pĩ , didst not give .
Na is sometimes added to the verb .
The usual order of words is subject , object , verb .
Numerals follow , and demonstrative pronouns and genitives precede the word they qualify .
For further details the student is referred to the version of the Parable of the Prodigal Son which follows and to the list of Standard Words and Phrases on pp .
At all events , we can safely assume that Rangkas is the form of speech used by Bhōṭiās all over Upper Johar and Upper Danpur .
Two specimens and a list of Standard Words and Phrases have been forwarded from the district .
Long and short vowels are often interchanged ; thus , jī and ji , I .
Similarly , the various vowels are often interchanged .
Compare ji , jē , jai-gō , my ; li-s , lē-s , and lai-s , said ; mī-s and mai-s , by a man ; sō , sū , sē , and s , the suffix of the case of the agent ; hvāsas and ka-hōsas , was lost ; rō , rī , ri , and r , the suffix of the terminative ; nyā and nē , the suffix of a conjunctive participle , and so forth .
In other cases it seems to denote a nasal pronunciation of the vowel ; thus , hū~ṭ , camel ; si-chãn , dying .
Hard and soft consonants are apparently very freely interchanged ; thus , g and k , the suffix of the genitive ; rā-ch and rā-j , came ; dhuk and ṭuk , all ; bhung-nyā and pun , tall .
S sometimes interchanges with ch ; thus in the suffix of past time .
We have no information regarding accentuation or tones .
Article .
Tā , a shorter form of the numeral tā-kā , one , and indefinite pronouns such as khamī , khami-rī , and khami-r , some ; gub , some , and gār , some , are used as indefinite articles ; thus , tā naukar , a servant ; khamī bā , a father ; khamir mī , a man ; gub rhã , a horse ; gār sã-khu , in a village .
Nouns .
There are no instances in the materials available of any suffixes or prefixes used in order to distinguish gender .
horse-woman , show that Rangkas in this respect agrees with other neighbouring forms of speech .
Number .
The plural is not distinguished by means of any suffix when it can be inferred from the context .
When required , a suffix chan , chã or chā appears to denote the plural ; thus , bē-chan , the bides ; khvi-chã , dogs ; bē-chā-k , of the skins .
In khamiri ni-chā~-k ( i.e., mī-chā~-k ) niśī sēri , one man-of two sons , the same suffix has apparently been used in order to form an honorific singular .
A kind of plural can also be effected by adding words such as titi , mhan , many , and so forth ; thus , bā titi , fathers ; mhan bā , fathers .
Case .
The various cases are apparently often interchanged .
Thus both the genitive and the dative are used as accusatives , the genitive also occurs with the function of a dative , and so forth .
The regular case system is apparently as follows .
The nominative and the accusative , i.e., the cases of the subject of intransitive verbs and of the object , are not distinguished by means of any suffix , although the genitive and the dative sometimes occur in the function of the object .
The subject of transitive verbs is usually put in the case of the agent , which is formed by adding the suffix sō , sū , sī , or s ; thus , bā-sō lē-s , father-by said , the father said ; nyāpan-su lī-s , small-by said , the younger said .
The same form is also used as an instrumental ; thus , chābuk-sō , with stripes .
The usual suffix of the dative is chabã or chubã , also written j-bãng and even j-chubã ; thus , bā-chubã , to the father ; bã-j-chubã , to the father ; u-j-bãng , to him .
In u-g khamiri-ś kharī ma dā-ś , his anyone-by anything not gave , no one gave him anything , the genitive has apparently been used instead of the dative , or else there is a dative suffix g , k.An ablative is formed by adding the suffix paṭṭī or baṭī .
The suffix of the genitive takes the forms gō , gu , g , and k ; thus , bā-gō , of the father ; mī-g , of a man .
So far as we can judge from the specimens , the terminative is commonly used as a locative .
It is formed by adding the suffix rō , rī , ri , or r ; thus , la-rō .
Other locative suffixes are su , sū , or similar forms , and khũ ; thus , khung-su , at the bottom ; sã-khũ , in the village .
Postpositions are sometimes added to the base and sometimes to the genitive .
Adjectives .
Adjectives precede the qualified noun in the nominative .
In nyāpan-sō sērī dhuk-chhan dū-nyā , the small-by son all gathering , the younger son having gathered all , the case suffix has been added to the adjective nyāpan and not , as we would expect , to the noun .
The particle of comparison is hvē ; thus , u pi-khan u rhangśyā hvē mhan mhan śini , his brother his sister from more tall is ; dukh hvē jhyān , all from good , best .
Numerals .
The first numerals are found in the list of words .
They precede the noun they qualify .
