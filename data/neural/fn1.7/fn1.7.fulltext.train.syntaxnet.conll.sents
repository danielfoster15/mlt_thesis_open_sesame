It has not , however , been possible to procure trustworthy materials illustrating its various forms .

It has been forwarded in Dēvanāgarī characters with an interlinear translation , but without any transliteration .
The transliteration does not , however , agree with the Dēvanāgarī text , and it has turned out to be so full of mistakes that it has been of no use whatever .
The notes on Gadabā grammar which follow are entirely based on the Bastar specimens .
Semi-consonants are perhaps used in words such as ḍā~ , Santālī dāk ’ , water ; gōy , Santālī gâch ’ , die ; gōgō and gōgōb , to tend , and so forth .
Vowels are often interchanged .
The n of the genitive suffix nū has apparently been replaced by l in lāy-lū , whose ?
Nouns .
If we can trust the specimens , there are no traces of a difference between animate and inanimate nouns , or of the existence of a dual .
The plural appears to be expressed by adding some word meaning ‘ many ’ ; thus , lōṅgā āpōṅg , many fathers , fathers .
A suffix nēn or nan occurs in forms such as sākhī-nēn , the witnesses ; kumbaī-nan , women .
The cases of the direct and indirect object are not expressed in the verb .
The suffix of the genitive is nō , nū , or nā ; thus , āpāṅg-nō , of a father ; kalār-nē-nū , of the liquor seller .
In pīlē kirtā-r khōgīr , the white horse ’ s saddle , we have perhaps a genitive suffix r .Other postpositions are kuruṅg , from ; bō , in , to , etc.
Numerals .
The first numerals will be found in the list of words .
It will be seen that Aryan loan-words are used in Bastar for the numerals seven and following .
The Gadabā numerals are most closely related to those in use in Savara and Khaṛiā .
Pronouns .
The following are the personal pronouns : The form pē-nug , our , in the list of words is probably a mistake .
A form lē , we , seems to occur as a verbal suffix .
Datives and accusatives are apparently formed by prefixing u or ō ; thus , ō-nīṅg , to me ; u-māy , him ; ō-māy , to him ; ōn ō-maī sunō , the son said to him .
Demonstrative pronouns are tē , this ; tō , tu , and nāi , that .
Interrogative pronouns are lai , who ?
Indefinite pronouns are formed from the interrogatives ; thus , laikī , anybody ; maṅgsā and māṅg-ḍig , anything .
Verbs .
The inflexion of verbs is apparently very simple .
Reduplicated and doubled bases are apparently freely used ; thus , sa-saḍagū , attached ; buk-buk , striking , etc.
The direct and the indirect objects do not appear to be expressed in the verb .
The subject is not expressed by means of pronominal suffixes .
traces of a state of affairs which is related to that prevailing in typical Muṇḍā languages .
The above passage which I have been able to restore with some certainty from the very corrupt original , contains the suffixed pronouns nīṅg ( or īṅg ) , I ; pēn , you ; lē , we , used to express the subject .
The common suffix of the present tense is tō or tu ; thus , māṅg-tō , I know ; ḍu-tu , is ; buk-tu , beats ; gō-gōy-ḍu-tu , I am dying .
In māhāparū-nu hukum ār mānī-tōniṅg , God ’ s order not obey-I ; sun-tunī , I will say , and so forth , the tense suffix is perhaps likewise tun , tōn , and the final iṅg or ī must then be the old form of the personal pronoun of the first person singular .
In sun-tōn-ēn , they say , the final ēn is perhaps the suffix of the third person .
Another suffix of the present is nīṅg ; thus , ōinīṅg , go .
The suffix ēḍ in ḍēm-ēḍ-nīṅg ḍutō , doing-I am , seems to correspond to Santālī et ’ .
According to the list of words a suffix bē is added ; thus , buk-tū-bē , I shall strike .
Other future forms are pi-lam , it will come ; nāi-lōṅg , I will go .
The past is formed by adding one of the suffixes u or o , and ī ; thus , ḍu-g-u , was ; sun-ō , said ; ju-ō , saw ; gōi-g-ī , died ; ōig-ī , went ; ōn-ī , heard .
Forms such as buōnēn , killed ; suōnēn , threw , etc., probably contain a pronominal suffix of the third person .
Compound past tenses are formed by adding the verb substantive ; thus , buō-ḍutu , I have killed ; sēbō ḍugu , I had killed ; nīṅg-nu ōḍu-ōn gōē-gu ḍugu mīyō bur-lagu ; bīsugu ḍugu mīō bōgu , my son dead was and revived ; lost was and was found .
I cannot analyse the suffixes in sōbōnō , boughtest , and sōbōnam , I bought .
The common suffix of the imperative is nēn ; thus , tōl-nēn , bind , ju-nēn , see .
Other imperatives are ō-māy nān-bē , to-him give ; luḍōrīng , take ; inḍē , give me ; ā dēmō , do not ; nīṅg samō-su sārdā ḍēmō , let us eating merry make .
The re-duplicated and the present bases are used as verbal nouns .
A suffix g is apparently added in some cases ; thus , māy tu-nū pī-pīg-nu bēlā , he there coming-of time , when he returned ; bun-ḍēg-nu mēnḍēg-nu kōlār ōni , music-of dancing-of sound heard .
The various bases are also used as participles ; thus , buk-buk , beating ; gō-gōb , grazing ; buō , struck , having struck .
Conjunctive participles are formed by adding su ; thus , āāē lē-lē kōpaṭ ēto-su ō-māy bōḍī , all good-good cloth bringing to-him give ; māy mōḍgu-su māy-nu āpuṅg-lai , he having arisen his father-to ( went ) ; mai juō-su māyē ḍēmo , he having-seen pity made .
The negative particle is a prefixed ār or urā ; compare Kherwārī ālō .
How these Kachārīs got their name , and how they migrated into Cachar has been described when dealing with the Bâṛâ language and need not be repeated here .
The two languages , like the speakers of them , have certainly a common origin , but they differ so much that one cannot be called a dialect of the other .
Both possess all the typical peculiarities which belong to languages of the Bodo group , but Dīmā-sā differs more from Bâṛâ than Gārō does , and the latter , also belonging to the Bodo group , is universally considered as a separate language .
I , therefore , class Dīmā-sā as a separate language also .
I have hence followed my predecessors in classing it as a separate language , a sort of border form of speech between Bâṛâ and Dīmā-sā , possessing points of resemblance with both .
According to some authorities , Hōjai is only another name for Dīmā-sā , and both names represent identically the same language .

Page_Divider_Tag The following imperfect sketch of Dīmā-sā grammar is based on the information provided by the specimens and the list of words .
The plural is formed by the suffix rao , spelt rău by Mr.Endle .
That gentleman also mentions a plural suffix nishi , which does not appear in the specimens or list of words .
We find , however , shi added to the genitives of pronouns , to form a plural in Hōjai .
The suffix of the Accusative-Dative is kē , Mr.Endle ’ s khô .
He also mentions a Dative suffix ne for which I have no authority .
The Instrumental suffix is jung , and that of the Genitive is nī .
That of the Ablative is nī-fārang , which Mr.Endle writes ni-frang .
The Locative suffix is hā .
We thus get the following declension : As in other Bodo languages , generic prefixes are used with the numerals .
For nonrational animate objects in general , and when the numerals are used alone in counting , the prefix is mā .
For human beings the prefix is shao , as shūbāng shao-shī , one man .
For inanimate objects the most usual prefix is gārāng , as nō gārāng-ginnī , two houses , but for objects of the vegetable kingdom , fāng is used , as in bongfang fāng-ji , ten trees .
The forms given for the Pronouns by Mr.Endle differ somewhat from those found in the specimens and list of words and agree better with Hōjai .
I give the forms according to both authorities : Note how , in the case of pronouns , the plural suffix is usually tacked on to the genitive .
This does not occur in the case of nouns .
There appear to be pronominal prefixes in use .
This tendency to generalise the pronominal prefix of the third person is very common in languages which use this method of prefixing pronouns to words of relationship .
The Verb Substantive is dōng or dao , is ; dōng-bā or dōng-kā , was .
The verb is conjugated as follows .
Causal verbs are formed , as in Bâṛâ , by adding the root meaning ‘ to give , ’ in Dīmā-sā rī , to the main verb .
A negative sentence is formed in two ways .
Or else a negative conjugation is used , of which the typical sign is the letter ā .
This language is reported from the following localities : Tipurā has also been reported as spoken in Sylhet , but an examination of the specimens received from that district shows that the language is really Hallāmī , spoken by immigrants from the State of Hill Tipperah , and belonging to the Kuki , not the Bodo Group .
They show no dialectic differences , only slight variations of spelling , which might be expected in recording an unwritten language .
In the Chittagong Hill Tracts the language is also called Mrung .

Hence the pronunciation of the letter s must be considered as doubtful .
Several suffixes are used to form the plural .
The sign of the Accusative-Dative is no , as in bā-no , to the father .
The sign of the Ablative is ni-thāni or ong-oi-sē , as in bā-ni thāni , or bā-ong-oi-sē , from the father .
The sign of the Genitive is ni , as in bā-ni , of the father .
The sign of the Locative is go or aō , as in yākum-go , on the foot ; no-go , in the house ; yāg-aō , on the hand .
The following are instances of the use of pronominal prefixes : ni-ni no-sālā , your son ; ni-ni no-fāung , your younger brother ; ni-ni no-fā , your father ; bi-ni bu-fā or bi-ni bo-fā , his father .
As regards verbs , the usual verb substantive is tong , with a present tong-ō , and a past tong-khā .
At least we find a present ong-o , an infinitive ong-nā-ni , to be , and a negative form ong-li-ā , am not ( compare the Gārō form ) .
The verb nāng means “ become .” The following suffixes are used in conjugation : Present , o or ō , as in āng-bu-o or āng bu-ō , I strike .
The second person singular and plural takes di , as in nung bu-di , thou beatest .
Future , ā-nu , as in āng bu-ā-nu , I shall strike .
Past , khā or kā , as in bu-khā , struck , sā-kā , said .
( Probably here , as in Bengali-written Gārō , the aspiration is superfluous ) .
Imperative , The second person takes di , as in bu-di , strike .
There is a termination mā-ni , the use of which is not clear from the specimens .
The following instances of negative verbs occur : Ong-li-ā , am not ; ru-li-ā , gave not ; kān-li-ā , did not wear ; thung-li-ā , did not play .
As in other Bodo languages , the causal verb is formed by suffixing the verb ‘ to give ’ to the main verbs ; thus , kān-ru-di , cause to wear .
The conjugation of the verb is specially worthy of notice .
To this he is referred for much information regarding the tribe and its speech which is necessarily omitted from this brief sketch .
The following brief sketch of Chutiyā grammar is entirely based on Mr.Brown ’ s work , to which the reader is referred for a full and detailed account of the many interesting philological facts which are displayed by this language .
SKELETON CHUTIYĀ GRAMMAR .
NOUNS .
No gender of inanimate objects .
Animate objects prefix mukagu ( male ) for the masculine and mishigu ( female ) for the feminine .
Nouns expressing relationship either use special words for each gender ( bābā , father ; yoyo , mother ) , or take special terminations ( pisha , son ; pishā-si , daughter ) .
The plural number is formed by suffixing raju , laju , or chiga .
In declension , the nominative singular , as in Kachārī , may take a , giving the force of the definite article .
The following is a specimen declension : Adjectives usually , but not always , precede the noun .
The comparative is formed by adding gāri or gārike to the accusstive of the noun with which comparison is made , e.g., ghora-na gārike lokoko , stronger than the horse .
The superlative is formed by using muguro or mugurone all , as in mugoro-na gārike loi , harder than all , hardest .
Numerals take qualifying prefixes as usual ; examples are .
for human beings , dugu or duku ; for animals , abstract nouns , and indefinitely mu .
PRONOUNS .
Personal pronouns have two plurals each a long and a short .
They are declined as follows , only the genitive is irregular .
The suffixes ne and re may be added after the case terminations .
The plural of the first person is often used in the sense of the singular .
Pronominal prefixes occur in ja-ba , my father ; ja-yo , my mother .
Other pronouns are sā , who ?
( adjective ) .
VERBS .
The conjugation of the verb is based on the same principles as those which we meet in other Bodo languages .
There is a negative conjugation of which the typical note is the vowel ā .
The main peculiarity of the Chutiyā verb is that , besides the usual tense suffixes , there may also be added infixes to the root which modify its meaning , not only giving the idea of mood , but also modifying the sense in a more ebscure way .
Root + modifying infix + negative + tense suffix .
There are two conjugations .
The following are examples of the positive and negative forms of both conjugations .
Every root ends in a vowel : The verbal noun may be declined as a gerund , thus , lari-ba-yo , of giving , and so on .
Irregular Verbs .
The verb khe , go , takes an infix ro , as follows .
The negative form khi-yā is conjugated regularly .
The Verbs Substantive are .
There is a future du-n , and a participle du-mto .
The Assamese ho ( Second conjugation ) is also used .
3 .sā , to become ( First conjugation ) is regular .
The negative of du is , present , jā ; past , jā-m ; plup ., jā-rumde ; fuṭ , jā-n ; disj .
Another Defective Verb is no-i ( neg .
The Passive is formed by conjugating the past passive participle with sā .
Adjective verbs suffix verbal terminations to adjectives .
Mā forms a potential verb ...
The word Bāgṛī , or more correctly Bāgᵃṛī , literally means the language of the Bāgaṛ country .
The language of Shekhawati , etc., though closely allied to Bāgṛī , is not that dialect , and has been already dealt with on pp .
The word Bāgaṛ also appears under the form Bāṅgar , and this , in its turn , gives its name to the dialect of Western Hindī called Bāṅgarū which is mainly spoken in East Hissar , Delhi District , and Karnal .
Bāṅgarū is a form of speech quite different from Bāgṛī .
The latter is a dialect of Rājasthānī .
It represents Mārwāṛī merging into Pañjābī and Bāṅgarū , and though it is certainly affected by these two forms of speech , its backbone is essentially Mārwāṛī .
There is , however , no hard-and-fast division between the two forms of speech .
Here a mixed language is spoken , which I have classed as a form of Ahīrwāṭī .
Bāgṛī and Shēkhāwāṭī.Shēkhāwāṭī, which is spoken immediately to the south of Bāgṛī , is often said to be the same as that dialect , but that is not the fact .
The only account of the dialect with which I am acquainted is in Mr.J .Wilson ’ s Final Report on the Revision of Settlement of the Sirsă District in the Punjăb , 1879-83 .
there is a general account of the dialect , and Appendix II gives a brief grammar , and some short verses in the dialect .
Grammar .
The pronunciation of Bāgṛī mainly differs from that of the neighbouring Pañjābī and Bāṅgarū in being broader in its vowel sounds .
The vowel ā sounds almost like the a in ‘ all ’ .
Similarly in pronouncing the other vowels a speaker of Bāgṛī makes them as broad as he can , while a speaker of Pañjābī often cuts them short , at the same time often doubling the following consonant , e.g ., Bāgṛī ṭābar , a child , Pañjābī tabbar , a family ; Bāgṛī ṭībā , Pañjābī ṭibbā , a sandhill ; Bāgṛī küṭ , Pañjābī kuṭṭ , a bruise .
Thus the suffix # gē ( sign of the conjunctive participle ) is as often as not written # ga .
In the pronunciation of consonants k is often pronounced as g .
This is most noticeable in the suffix of the genitive # gō , which is often written # kō or even kā , but is always pronounced gō , the ō having a tendency to be pronounced like aw .
As in Standard Marwāṛī , a medial h is commonly dropped , as in kasū~ , for kahᵃsū~ , I will say ; kayō , for kahyō , said ; chāyō , for chāhyō , he wished .
The other comes from the Punjab district of Hissar , and shows the language as influenced by Bāṅgarū .
I do not propose to give a complete grammar .
Bāgṛī closely resembles Mārwāṛī , and reference can be made to the grammar of that language , on pp .
As already stated , I take the Bāgṛī of Bikaner as the standard .
Declension .
The declension of nouns closely follows Mārwāṛī .
Strong tadbhava nouns of the a base , have their nominative singular in ō , as in Mārwāṛī .
Thus : The ō of the nominative is sometimes written ā , under the influence of Pañjābī or Bāṅgarū , but its sound is that of ō , or of the aw in ‘ caw ’ ( see above ) .
The case of the agent of these nouns ends in ē in the singular , and ā~ in the plural .
The suffix nai or nē is not used for this case except under the influence of neighbouring languages .
In the case of other nouns , the Agent Singular is the same as the nominative , while the plural ends in ā~ .
The oblique plural of all nouns ends in ā~ .
For the case-postpositions , the Dative-Accusative suffixes are gē , nē , and ( in Hissar ) nai , nū~ .
It is really , as usual , the locative of the genitive postposition gō .
The suffixes of the Instrumental-Ablative are sū~ and tā .
The Locative has a variety of suffixes , of which the commonest are mā~ and mē~ .
The Genitive suffix is peculiar to Bāgṛī , and is typical of the dialect .
It is gō , oblique gā , locative and agent masc .
As usual gē is used before a noun in the agent or locative case singular , and gā before other oblique cases .
and it is often used instead of gā , and becomes the general form of the oblique genitive masculine , following the example of Pañjābī and Hindōstānī .
Adjectives require few remarks .
Strong tadbhava adjectives of a - bases , end in ō , and are treated exactly like the genitive terminations .
Pronouns .
The pronouns of the first and second persons are as follows .
Maĩ and taĩ are only used in the Agent case , not in the nominative .
In both pronouns the plural is frequently used in the sense of the singular .
The Demonstrative Pronouns are yō or ō , this , and bō , that .
They have feminine forms in the nominative singular only , viz ., yā or ā , this ; bā , that .
The Relative pronoun is jakō ( gen .ji-gō ) , fem .
It is often used in the sense of a demonstrative pronoun , as all over Rajputana .
The Interrogative Pronouns are kun .
( genitive ki-gō ) who ?
In Hissar , we have kihyā~ and kā~ī~ for what ?’ Kū~hī~ is ‘ anything ’ and kōī ( oblique forms the same ) is ‘ anyone ’ .
CONJUGATION Auxiliary Verb and Verb Substantive .
Note that the third person plural is not nasalized .
In Sirsa , and other parts affected by Bāṅgarū or Ahīrwāṭī , we have , The past is In Hissar and other parts affected by Bāṅgarū and Ahīrwāṭī , we have thō , thā , thī .
Finite Verb .
As usual in Rājasthānī the tense which in Hindōstānī is the present subjunctive is used in its original sense of a present indicative .
Thus : Present .
In Hissar , the third person plural is mārē~ .
The Definite Present is formed by conjugating the preceding tense ( not the present participle ) with the verb substantive .
Thus : Definite Present .
The Imperfect is formed by conjugating the past tense of the Auxiliary verb with a verbal noun in ē .
It does not change for person .
In Hissar and the neighbourhood , the present participle is used , as in Hindōstānī .
The Future , as in Bikaner and elsewhere in Rajputana , has the letter s as its characteristic .
It is conjugated as follows .
Future .
In Hissar the s becomes s , pronounced like an English sh , and we have the following conjugation : The following are the Verbal Nouns and Participles : Infinitive , mārᵃbō , mārᵃṇō , māraṇ , to strike .
Present Participle , mārᵃtō , striking .
Past Participle , māryō ( often written māriō ) , struck .
Noun of Agency , māraṇ-āḷō , mārᵃṇē-āḷō , a striker .
From these elements the remaining tenses can be formed as in Hindōstānī .
Tenses formed from the past participle of a transitive verb require , as usual , the subject to be in the case of the agent .
As regards irregular verbs , they are as usual , except that the past participle of karan .
The Mārwāṛī compound verbs with parō and warō occur in Bāgṛī .
The Mārwāṛī termination ṛō is common with adjectives and participles .
A common form of the negative is kō-nī~ , which is also frequently met elsewhere in Rajputana .
In the second specimen , the phrase ghaṭē na badhē , neither diminishes nor increases , deserves notice .
The negative na , not , refers both to the preceding and to the following verb .
The suffix ān , i.e.
probably ā~ , is used to indicate an object of the first person singular in pī-ān , give me .
The forms yē , in-chhūng and in-ngā , it is , yes , seem to show that the base alone , and with one of the suffixes chhūng and ngā , can be used as a present .
The mere base is also used as an imperative ; thus , nē , take ; mō , do .
Other imperatives are formed by adding ō , ū , and ā ; thus , chō , eat ; dūng-ū , drink ; yosu , strike ; ipsā sleep ; bānā , come , etc.
We do not know anything about the meaning of the consonants preceding the final vowel of such imperatives .
The negative particle is a prefixed mā or man ; thus , mā-nā , not-is , no ; man-duwako , not ripe , raw .
Hodgson also mentions a negative suffix īsi .
The negative with imperatives is na .
Nouns .
The prefix ūm in ūm ’ pā , faher ; ūm ’ mā , mother , etc., is identical with the pronoun ūm , his , her , its .
Gender is distinguished by using different words or by adding suffixes or words such as ūm ’ pā , umprūpa , male ; ūm ’ mā , ummrūma , female .
There are three numbers , the singular , the dual , and the plural .
The suffix chi is said to be used both in the dual and in the plural ; thus , mik ’ , eye , dual and plural mi ’ chi .
In the case of adjectives we find a dual suffix chia and a separate plural suffix miha ; thus , nūyē , good , dual nuk-chia , plural nuk-miha .
The genitive is expressed by putting the governed before the governing word without any suffix ; thus , pi ’ pasā , cow ’ s young , calf .
If the governing word is understood , the suffix mi is added ; thus , kāngā-mi , mine .
Other relations are indicated by adding postpositions , such as be , bī , in ; bāng , pāng , from ; ē , yē , by ; nūng , with , and so on .
Numerals .
The first numerals are given in the table on p .342 .
The forms ending in pang , bang , are used when the qualified noun denotes male or female 
individuals , those ending in chi are neuter .
It will be seen that higher numbers are counted in tens .
Pronouns .
The following are the personal pronouns : It will be seen that the dual and the plural are confounded in the third person , as in the case of nouns .
It looks as if the dual were gradually giving way to the plural .
Mō , he , is also used as a demonstrative pronoun meaning ‘ that ’ .
The corresponding nearer demonstrative is īgo , this .
The real base is ī , and the suffix go can also be added to mō ; thus , mōgo-chi , they .
The dual of īgo is given as iga-chi , these two .
Interrogative pronouns are āsā , who ?
They can be changed to indefinite pronouns by adding sāng ; thus , āsā-sāng , anyone ; imāng-sāng , anything .
Verbs .
The subject of the verb is probably indicated by adding pronominal suffixes ; thus , limuk-nga , I am sweet ; khik-nga and khik-ti-nga , I am bitter ; dūng-ē , drink thou ; dūnga-che , drink ye two ; dūnga-ne , drink ye .
There seems to be a suffix nga denoting a subject of the first person singular .
In the imperative , a dual or plural subject is indicated by adding che , ne , respectively .
Those forms are identical with the dual and plural suffix of personal pronouns .
An m is sometimes inserted before the n of the plural ; thus , sede , kill ; seda-che , kill ye two ; sedam-ne , kill ye .
A suffix ng is also used to denote an object of the first person ; thus , pī-ng-ē , give me .
The t in pit-t-ē , give him , is perhaps a corresponding suffix of the third person .
Forms such as mō nū , that is good ; īgo nū , this is good ; medding , it is not , show that the base alone can be used as a present .
We have no other information about the formation of the various tenses .
The suffix of the imperative is e , dual a-che , plural a-ne or am-ne ; thus , dābe , come ; dāba-che , come ye two ; dābā-ne , come ye ; lome , strike ; loma-che , strike ye two ; lomam-ne , strike ye .
Causals are formed by suffixing mette ; thus , dung-mette , cause him to drink ; im-mette , cause him to sleep .
The negative particle is apparently a prefixed me ; thus , medding , not-is , without .
A suffixed ni is used in words such as nā-ni , good-not .
A negative imperative is formed by prefixing e ’ ; thus , e ’ - dūbe and e ’ - tōnge , do not make .
Nouns .
The prefix ī and īm in words such as ī-chhā and chhā , child ; ī-thin and thin , egg ; ī-lēmba , day ; īm-pā , father ; īm-mā , mother , etc., is by origin a pronoun ; compare īm , his , her , its .
Gender is distinguished by using different terms , or else by adding suffixes or words indicating the sex .
We have no information about the suffixes added in the dual and the plural .
The suffix chhi in chhā-chhi , child ; pā-chhi , mau ; mā-chhi , woman , is perhaps a dual suffix .
The genitive is expressed by putting the governed before the governing word and inserting the possessive pronoun corresponding to the former before the latter ; thus , pit ’ ī-chhā , cow its-young , calf ; sing-ī-tāngli , wood-its-plant , tree .
The possessive pronoun can be dropped ; thus , tang phūkwa , head hair , the hair of the head ; wā-thin , bird ’ s egg .
The suffix khā , of , is probably identical with the final kha in numerous adjectives , such as nūyukkha , good ; kūyū-kha , hot , etc.
Ngāka , of , is perhaps miswritten for ngākhā , and contains the suffix ngā , by .
Name of the Language .
Hō is the name of a tribe , and the language is often called Hō-kājī , i.e.
the language of the Hōṣ The word Hō is identical with hâr .
In Singbhum , however , Hō is the predominant language , even if we consider the Aryan forms of speech .

Thus the copula tan is also written ton and ten .
The semi-consonants are treated as in Muṇḍārī .
The final t ’ of verbal tenses commonly becomes d or d., or else it is retained , but very weakly sounded .
In the grammar called Hokaji , mentioned above under authorities , forms such as jom-akaḍ-a-iṅg , I have eaten , are said to be used when there is no animate object .
The following remarks on Zahao grammar are entirely founded on the specimen .
But it is probable that final vowels of words and syllables are long , just as they are in Lushēi .
The pronunciation of other vowels cannot always be stated with certainty .
The consonant k in pek , to give , is sometimes dropped .
Articles .
There are no articles .
The numeral pa-khat , one , and indefinite pronouns may be used as a kind of indefinite article , while pronominal prefixes , demonstrative pronouns , and relative phrases supply the place of a definite article .
Nouns .
Gender .
There is only one suffix used to denote gender in the specimen .
The word vok , pigs , is combined with the plural pronominal prefix ; thus , vok-in an ei , the-pigs they ate .
Number .
There are two numbers , the singular and the plural .
The suffix of the plural seems to be le ; thus , boih-le , servants ; ka-hoi-le-i-nhena , my friends with .
The Nominative , the Accusative , and the Dative are not distinguished by suffixes .
The Genitive is denoted by putting the stem , without any suffix , before the governing word ; thus , ro ka chan-ding ; property-of my share .
But usually the suffix i is added ; thus , van-i mi , the sky ’ s man , the man of the sky .
The same suffix is also used in Lai .
The genitive relation may also be indicated by apposition .
The i added to fa-pa before the infinitive vua , to bear , also shows the near connection between the verbal noun and ordinary substantives .
The suffix in , denoting the agent , is added to the noun when it is the subject of a transitive verb .
It is dropped , however , in the first clause before nei , had , where the singular pronominal prefix a shows that the subject is the noun mi-zo , a man , and not fa-pa pa-nhih , two sons .
The suffixes a and in or i form locatives and adverbial expressions ; thus kut-a , hands-on ; lhim tak-in , joy great-in , joyfully ; lha-tak-i , far very .
Adjectives follow the noun they qualify , and case suffixes are added to them and not to the qualified noun .
The suffix of the comparative is sha^n ; thus , nao-ta sha^n , young more .
An absolute superlative is formed by the addition of bik , most .
The only numerals occurring in the specimen are pa-khat , one , and pa-nhih , two .
Both are only used to qualify human beings , and pa is the generic prefix .
They follow the noun they qualify .
Pronouns .
The specimen contains the following Personal pronouns : Singular , Plural , The forms ka , I , kan , we ; na , thou ; a , he , an , they , are used as pronominal prefixes with verbs .
Compare Nouns , above .
The following Demonstrative pronouns occur ; hi , and hi hi , this ; chu , and chu chu , and chui chu , that ; kha , that .
There is no Relative pronoun .
The demonstrative pronouns are used as a kind of correlative ; thus , ziang-ma^ ka^m vok-in an ei kha , whatever food the pigs they ate , that ; cha^ no thao zet kha , cow young fat very that .
Relative clauses are also formed by means of participles and verbal nouns .
In the last instance ei-thluk-tu is the noun of agency .
An Interrogative pronoun is ziang-ha , what , in chu ziang-ha shi-kei , that what may it be ?
The following Indefinite pronouns occur : shi-ma^ , a certain ; ziang-ma^ , whatever ; ziang-lo , some ; zo-mhan , anyone ; ziang-mhan , anything .
Verbs .
Verbs are conjugated in person and number by means of pronominal prefixes .
After zo-mhan , anyone , the plural prefix is used ; thus , zo-mhan an pek-shi-lo-v-i , anyone they gave not .
Pronominal prefixes are usually dropped before the imperative , and when the subject is an interrogative pronoun .
The suffix i , probably a verb substantive , is commonly added to the various tenses of the verb .
The root alone is freely used to denote present and past tenses .
The suffixes i , hi , and shi , all various forms of the verb substantive , may be added ; thus , a-ti-i , he said ; a-shi-hi , he is ; an-pek-shi-lo-vi , they gave not .
After hi the suffix teh is added in ka shi-lo-hi-teh , I am not .
This teh is perhaps identical with the suffix of the past tense .
The suffixes of Past tenses are ta or tak and a^ ; thus , a fe-ta-i , he went ; ka-ti-shual-tak , I sinned ; an um-tlang-a^-i , they to-be-began .
The suffix ta seems also to be used in the present tense in order to denote an established fact .
A kind of Perfect is effected by the addition of the verb substantive to the principal verb .
The suffix of the Future is kei ; thus , ka tho-kei-i , I will arise ; ka ti-kei , I will say .
This tense is also used in interrogative sentences to denote what might be , just like the German future .
Compare the suffix ka which denotes the present and past times in Ngentē , Rāltē , Paitē , etc.
Another suffix of the future seems to be ing in i-ku-shing , let us make merry .
The suffix of the Imperative is a^ , a^h , or o ; thus , pe-a^ , give ; thah-o , kill you .
A first person plural occurs in i-ku-shing , let us make merry .
The root alone is also used as an Infinitive or verbal noun .
This form is used as a substantive governing a genitive ; thus , ka mhing hi na fa-pa-i vua tlak , my name this thy son-of bearing worthy , worthy to the bearing of my name of your son .
These instances show how little our usual grammatical categories suit these languages .
The Infinitive of purpose seems to be formed by the suffix ding or ding-in ; thus , vok ra^l-tla pe-ding-in , in order to give the pigs food ; ei-ding , for eating , food .
La^m , to rejoice ; a^k , perhaps corresponding to the Lai suffix a^k which is used to form gerunds ( thus Lai ding-a^k , for drinking ) .
Nāk is used in Lai to form compound nouns ( thus , thi-nāk , something for killing , poison ) .
The Lai suffix nāk is also used to form participles , and this use seems also to be found in Zahao , in ka-el-nak-um-shi-lo , I transgressing lived-not .
Compare the suffix nā which forms verbal nouns in Hallām , Langrong , Mhār , etc.
A Participle used instead of the first of two connected imperatives is formed by adding the suffix la , to which a pronominal element seems to be prefixed .
Only one instance occurs , where the pronominal element is o , denoting the second person plural .
The pronominal element of the third person singular is perhaps she or se , in shi-kal-she-la , nevertheless , lit .
Conjunctive participles seem to be formed by adding the suffix i ; thus a-tho-v-i a-pa-i nhen-a a fe-ta-i , he having arisen his father to he went .
This suffix may be added to all tenses .
The suffix leh in tlak ka-shi-lo-leh , worthy I-being-not , since I am not worthy , seems to be used in a similar way .
Compare Verbal nouns , above .
The suffix of the Adverbial participle is the locative suffix in ; thus , nha tuan-in a va-tang-i , work doing he went and stayed .
A Noun of Agency is formed by means of the suffix tu ; thus , ei-thluk-tu , a consumer .
See Relative pronoun , above .
There is no Passive voice .
Compound verbs are formed by means of prefixes or by suffixing other words .
The following prefixes occur : Hon , signifying motion upwards or towards ; rak , signifying motion away and towards ; va , signifying motion from .
Causatives are formed by suffixing shak or tir ; thus , thah-shak , to cause to kill ; bun-tir , to cause to wear , to put on .
The suffix seems to be at or ak .
Desideratives are formed by adding duh ; thus lut-duh , to wish to enter .
Other words suffixed in order to form compound verbs are .
Two verbs may , of course , be combined in order to modify the meaning .
The Negative particle is lo , or shi-lo ; thus , a lut-duh-lo-v-i , he to-enter wished not : an pek-shi-lo-v-i , they gave not .
The Interrogative particle is ma^ ; thus , shi-lo-ma^ , is-it not ?
Compare also the use of ma^ in the formation of indefinite pronouns ; thus , shi-ma^ , a certain .
The Tibetan dialects spoken to the east of Lahul and to the west of the Tibetan province of Khams agree in several important points .
The most salient feature of these forms of speech is the use of a system of tones which is foreign to the western dialects and to the language of Khams .
Compare the remarks in the general introduction to the Tibetan language .
Moreover , the dialects in question as a rule agree in simplifying the compound consonants of classical Tibetan .
The same is the case with the Tibetan of Lahul , and that dialect can therefore be described as a link between Western Tibetan and our group , which has been described as Central Tibetan .
It comprises the central dialect of Tibet , spoken in the provinces of U : and Tsang , and several smaller dialects spoken in British India , Nepal , Sikkim , and Bhutan .
The various dialects of Central Tibetan agree generally in grammar .
The compound consonants of classical Tibetan have , however , sometimes been simplified in different ways .
It will therefore be of interest to compare the phonology of these forms of speech with the written language of classical Tibetan .
The dialect of Central Tibet is the lingua franca of the Tibetan country , and it is generally understood everywhere in Tibet in addition to the local dialects .
Lhasa is situated in the former , and the Lhasa dialect has sometimes been described as the standard form of Tibetan .
It is comparatively well known , and it has been dealt with in most of the works mentioned under the head of authorities in the general introduction to the Tibetan language .
It is therefore not necessary to give a detailed account of its grammar .
It will be sufficient to draw attention to the principal features of phonology , as compared with the classical language of Tibetan literature , and to give a rapid sketch of the grammatical system .
The home of the Central Tibetan dialect does not fall within the scope of this Survey .
Nor are we in a position to judge how many of the six millions of people who are estimated to live in Tibet use that form of the language .
It is probable that some of these denominations cover some slightly different dialect .
It should also be borne in mind that several minor forms of speech such as Jaḍ , Nyamkat , Kāgate , Sharpa , Ḍänjongkä , Lhokä , etc., are closely related to the Tibetan of Lhasa .
According to information collected for the purposes of this Survey , Central Tibetan was spoken in the following districts where it has proved impossible to decide whether the speakers belong to any known sub-dialect : With regard to the corresponding figures returned at the last Census of 1901 , the remarks in the general introduction to Tibetan should be consulted .
Initial soft consonants are pronounced with a strong aspiration so that the actual sound is almost that of the corresponding hard consonant ; thus , bhu and pu , classical Tibetan bu , son .
Similarly , an inhabitant of Lhasa would say shing instead of classical zhing , field , and the only difference made between an initial sh corresponding to zh in classical Tibetan and an old sh is that the former is pronounced with the high tone .
Final d , n , s , and sometimes also l , modify a preceding vowel so that a becomes a : ; o becomes ö , and u becomes ü .
When d is dropped the preceding vowel is pronounced in an abrupt short way , in what is generally known as the abrupt tone .
When s is dropped the preceding vowel is lengthened .
Final n followed by p or b sounds as m .Final s after consonants is dropped and the preceding consonant is treated as if it were a final .
Compound consonants are simplified in various ways .
The written language , on the other hand , retains them in accordance with the practice of classical Tibetan .
Compounds of a mute consonant and a subscribed r become cerebrals .
Other compounds are simplified in such a way that the first consonant or consonants are dropped .
Article .
The numeral chik , one , is often used as an indefinite article .
After vowels , except o , and after m , r , or l , chik is often changed to shik .
The demonstrative pronouns di , this , dhe , that , are often used in the colloquial as a definite article ; thus , mi-dhe , the man ; ṭä-pa di , the ladder .
Nouns Gender .
Gender is distinguished in the usual way by means of different words or by adding suffixes or prefixes such as pa , po , etc., male ; ma , mo , etc., female ; thus , a-pha , father ; a-ma , mother : khyo-po , husband ; khyo-mo , wife : jha-pa , cock ; jha-mo , hen : yī-pa , boy ; mo-yī , girl , etc.
Number .
The usual plural suffixes are ts ho , cha or chak , and nam .
Case .
The subject of intransitive verbs and the object are not distinguished by means of suffixes .
The dative is formed by adding la ; thus , la-ma-la , to a monk .
The same form is also used as a locative .
The suffix na is used to form another locative .
The suffix of the ablative is nā : , or , sometimes , lā: .
The so-called terminative , which denotes motion towards and which is formed by adding one of the suffixes du , tu , su , ru , and r , is not in use in the colloquial .
The genitive is formed by adding gi after final k and ng ; i or yi after vowels , and kyi in all other cases .
The case of the agent is formed by lengthening the final i of the genitive ; thus , rang-gi , self of , own ; nga-i , my ; khye-kyi , your ; yap-kyī , by the father .
In words ending in a vowel the case of the agent is also formed by lengthening and modifying the vowel as if an s had been dropped ; thus , la-mā : or la-ma-yī , by a Lama .
Adjectives .
Adjectives almost always follow the noun they qualify .
In classical Tibetan they often precede it , being then placed in the genitive , and the same can also be the case in the colloquial .
The suffix lā : of the ablative is used as a particle of comparison ; thus , mi-dhe-lā : mi di ngän-pa-re , man-that-from man this bad-is , this man is worse than that man .
Pronouns .
The following are the personal pronouns : The plural is formed by adding the usual suffixes .
Rang , self , can be added to all the personal pronouns ; thus , nga-rang-ghi , my own .
Other pronouns are dak , kho-wo , nga- ts ok , I ; nyi-rang , nyi-chak , thou ; nge- ts ho , we ; kho-wa , dhe-dak , they ; mo , she ; di , this ; dhe , that ; di-ka , this one ; dhe-ga , that one ; ha-gi , that just yonder ; pha-gi , that far off ; ya-gi , that up there ; ma-gi , this down below ; su , who ?
Verbs .
Several bases are used as a verb substantive .
An intensive verb substantive is mö-pa , to be indeed .
The negative copula is min-pa , and the negative of yö-pa is me-pa .With regard to finite verbs it should be remarked that the modern colloquial in most cases uses the perfect base of the literary dialect in all tenses .
The o which is added to the verb in classical Tibetan is commonly dropped in the colloquial .
Present time .
The base alone is used as a present tense ; thus , kho-rang-ghī shambhu ghön , he wears a cap .
The most common present is , however , formed by adding yo : or du to the participle ending in ghi ( classical gin ) .
Ghi yo : is almost exclusively used in the third person .
Ghi can also be followed by yin and re , and the present ending in ghi-re is very common in Eastern Tibet .
Periphrastic presents are formed by adding the verb substantive to gang preceded by the genitive of the verbal noun ending in pa , wa , or to kap preceded by the base ; thus , nga ḍo-wai gang-yin , I am just going ; di ṭhi-kap-yö , I am just bringing it .
Past time .
A common past tense is formed by adding song , or , in the case of many verbs , jhung ; thus , shi-song , died ; thong-jhung , saw .
Such forms do not appear to be used in the first person .
A common past tense is also formed from the participle or verbal noun ending in pa , wa , by adding yin in the first person and du or re in the second and third .
The base alone is also employed ; thus , nang , gave .
Future .
The present is commonly used as a future ; thus , ngā : dung-ghi-yin , I shall beat .
Common suffixes are yong and gyu-yin , gyu-yō , etc.
Imperative .
The base alone is used as an imperative .
The imperative base of the classical dialect is often preserved ; thus , ḍo-wa , to go ; song , go : yong-wa , to come ; shok , come : khyak-pa , to carry ; khyok , carry : tak-pa , to tie ; tok , tie , etc.
Common suffixes are chik or shik , tang , and the more polite ro , ro-chik , or roch , ro-nang , ro- dz ö , nang-chi , etc.
Verbal nouns and participles .
The various tenses are in reality verbal nouns .
The most common verbal noun is , however , formed by adding pa or , if the base in classical Tibetan ends in a vowel or in r and l , wa ; thus , jhye-pa , to do ; ḍo-wa , to go .
Such forms are often used as finite tenses ; thus , shū:-pa , he said .
In connexion with case suffixes and postpositions they are used in order to form various kinds of adverbial clauses , infinitives , etc.
They are moreover used as verbal and relative participles .
When the participle ending in pa or wa precedes a qualified noun it is put in the genitive ; thus , ngā : thop-pai nor-käl , me-by getting-of property-share , the share of the property which I shall get ; mi-po nga-la dung-khän dhe , man me-to striking that , the man who struck me .
The participle is also used when the interrogative pronoun is applied as a kind of relative ; thus , nga-la gang yö-pa tham-cha : khyo : rang-ghi yin , me-to what being , all thine is .
A verbal noun , which is commonly used as an infinitive of purpose , is formed by adding gyu ; thus , sa-gyu , to eat .
Conjunctive participles are formed by adding case suffixes to the base or by means of special suffixes such as de and te , ching and shing ; thus , gang-la ser-na , ‘ why ?’ saying-in , if you ask why , because ; lang-nā : , arising-from , having arisen ; song-te , having gone ; cho-ching , doing ; sa-shing , eating , etc.
Negative particle .
The negative particle is a prefixed mi or ma .
In compound forms it precedes the last part of the compound .
Mi is used with the present and future tenses ; ma with the past tenses and the imperative ; thus , mi ōso , I am not worthy ; sa-mi-yong , I shall not eat ; khye-kyī ma nang , you did not give ; ma shok , don ’ t come .
It should be noted that the simple base is often used in the negative imperative even when the positive imperative differs ; thus , ma yong , not ma shok , don ’ t come .
Interrogative particle .
The interrogative particle is am , or usually simply a , before which a final consonant is doubled ; thus , lep-jhung-nga , has he arrived ?
For further details the student is referred to the works mentioned under the head of authorities in the general introduction to the Tibetan language and to the version of the Parable of the Prodigal Son which follows .
The latter is given in Tibetan characters and in transliteration .
The Tibetan text represents the literary language , and not the colloquial speech of the people .
It is written in the usual way , so that the spelling of the single words agrees with the form they assume in classical Tibetan .
A list of Standard Words and Phrases , based on the hand-books of Messrs .Sandberg and Henderson , will be found on pp .
The C harōtarī dialect of Gujarātī takes its name from this tract , but is spoken over a somewhat wider area , i.e.
Charōtarī closely resembles the other Gāmaḍiā dialect , but has also some peculiarities of its own .
This will be evident from the following sketch of its grammar .
I give two specimens of this dialect .
The vowel ā often has the sound of a broad o something between that of the o in not , and that of the aw in hawl .
It also occurs , but to a less extent , in the standard dialect .
The vowel a preceding a y is often optionally omitted .
The letter ī is often changed to ē .
A nasal at the end of a word is very frequently omitted .
When two terminations with nasals come close together , it seems to be most usual to omit one of the nasals ; thus , mār ũ - ts hu , for mār ũ - chh ũ , I am striking .
The letter h is often dropped , but there are not so many examples as in Surᵃtī .
The letter ch is frequently pronounced as ts ; chh as ts h ; j as dz ; and jh as dz h .
The pronunciation is so common that I have transliterated these letters ts , ts h , dz and dz h in the specimens and list of words .
The letter k often becomes ch ( ts ) especially under the influence of a neighbouring e or i , and kh often becomes chh ( ts h ) .
The letter s regularly becomes h .
Nouns .
As in Surᵃtī , nouns ending in a consonant have an oblique form in ā .
( especially in the case of neuter nouns ) , we have words like gharā~ , houses ; ts hētᵃrā~ , field ś .
Ś ī is a postposition of the instrumental , as in khu ś ī- ś ī , joyfully .
Pronouns .
The following are the first two personal pronouns : Other forms are as in the standard dialect .
The demonstrative pronouns , and the pronoun of the third person are as in the standard dialect , but we have also a form with an initial h .
Conjugation .
In the conjugation of the verb , the principal irregularity to be noted is that the second person singular ends ( like the first person ) in ũ as well as in ē .
The verb substantive is thus conjugated .
The past tense is either hatō , as in the standard , or utō , as in Surᵃtī .
When used as an auxiliary we also find tō .
The verb thaw ũ , to become , makes its past tense thayō or thyō .
As regards the finite verb , attention must be called to the frequent optional dropping of a final nasal .
The following is the definite present of mārᵃw ũ or mārᵃwu , to strike : The imperfect is mārᵃtō-utō or mārᵃtō-tō .
In none of the specimens have I met any instance of the ś of the future becoming h .
The following is the conjugation of this tense .
Note how the ī of the first and second persons singular is changed to ē , and how it is also optionally shortened to i .
The past participle is much as in the standard dialect .
The conjunctive participle is irregular in verbs whose roots end in long ā .
He has also been good enough to allow me to reprint a version of the Parable of the Prodigal Son and a list of Standard Words and Phrases .
Articles .
The numeral ī , one , is used as an indefinite article ; thus , ī miū~ , of a man ; ī sāhūkārē , a money lender .
Nouns .
The inflexion of nouns is in most particulars the same as in Manchāṭī .
Gender .
The natural gender is distinguished in the usual way ; thus , bā , father ; yā , mother : rhiz , male goat ; lā , female goat : taṛ-bhīṛ , male cat ; bhīṛ , female cat : ts hāh , horse ; nab-rhā~ , mare .
Number .
There are two numbers , the singular and plural .
The plural is not expressed when it appears from the context ; thus , hāthī , elephant , and elephants .
The usual plural suffix is r ; thus , rhī~ , sister ; rhī~-r , sisters : mīl-yō , daughter ; mīl-yōr , daughters .
Case .
The cases of the singular and of the plural differ in the same way as in Manchāṭī .
The subject of intransitive verbs and the object are not distinguished by adding suffixes .
The subject of transitive verbs , on the other hand , is put in the case of the agent , which is said to be formed by adding ts or , after vowels , ē in the singular and z in the plural ; thus , rhā~- ts , by a horse ; bā-ē , by a father ; mīl-yō-ē , by a daughter ; rh ānez , by the horses ; mīl-yō-z , by the daughters , sū~ra-z , by the swine .
The suffix of the dative is vi or bi ; plural dī ; thus , rhī~-vi and rhī~-bi , to a sister ; rhāne-dī , to horses ; mīl-yō-dī , to daughters .
The suffix of the genitive is u or ō , plural du ; thus , rhã-u , of a horse ; bā-ō , of a father ; mīū~ , of a man ( mī~ , man ) ; mīl-yō-du , of daughters .
The genitive can also be expressed by putting the governed before the governing noun , without any suffix ; thus , hāthī , of an elephant ; sā~sī rhān palānz , the white horse ’ s saddle .
The final n of rhān is probably developed from the nasal sound in rhā~ , horse .
The ablative is formed by adding do ts , i.e., dor- ts therefrom , to the base or to the genitive ; thus , rhā~-do ts , from a horse ; bā-ō do ts , from a father .
Do ts is by origin an ablative of the demonstrative pronoun du , do , and the actual suffix is ts as in the case of the agent .
A terminative and locative are formed by adding rī , arī ; thus , konz arī , on the foot ; nōkararī , to the servants ; rhī-rī , in the field .
A shorter suffix r occurs in dē-r , here ; du-r , there , etc.
It is perhaps connected with rā , plural da in nu-rā , on that side , dī-rā , on this side ; gē-rā sādē , with me ; rhī~-rā sādē , with his sister ; yāra-da sādē , with my friends .
Adjectives .
Adjectives precede the word they qualify ; thus , sāsī rhā~ , the white horse .
The particle of comparison is vē ; thus , rhī~ vē mōrē , sister than big , bigger than the sister .
Numerals .
The first numerals are given in the list of words .
Other numerals are sē-īdī , eleven , sha-shrum , thirteen ; sā-pī , fourteen ; sang , fifteen ; sā-trūī , sixteen ; sā-nhī , seventeen ; sā-rē , eighteen , sos-kū , nineteen .
Higher numbers are counted in twenties .
Ordinals are formed by adding mī ; thus , tū-mī , first ; juṛ-mī , second ; shrum-mī , third .
Pronouns .
The following are the personal pronouns : Note also ēnō , own .
A .H .Francke informs me that there are also dual forms of the pronouns , and , moreover , both exclusive and inclusive forms of the dual and plural of the first person .
Demonstrative pronouns are di , this ; du , that , and nu , that ( compare nuar , there ; nu-rā , on that side , etc.) .
Note dō dēshā-rī , in that country , where the demonstrative precedes the qualified noun in the genitive .
Interrogative and indefinite pronouns are ārī , who ?
The interrogative pronouns can also be used as relatives ; thus , aũ ghārī chumh kachā pī , what time house near came , when he approached the house ; anyō māl gē-bī pīpā gē-bī raũ , how-much property me-to comes me-to give , give me the property that falls to me .
Verbs .
The conjugation of verbs is the same as in Manchāṭī .
The pronominal suffixes added in order to distinguish the person of the subject are g , k , ga , or nothing for the first ; n and na for the second ; d , dō , or nothing for the third person singular ; ni for the first and second , and r for the third person plural .
Verb substantive .
The usual bases of the verb substantive are shu and to or ta .
Forms such as tod tōī are also used in the plural .
Forms such as todoni , tadoni , we are , are compounds containing the base to , ta , and an auxiliary do which is probably originally identical .
Finite verb .
The verb substantive plays a considerable rôle in the formation of the various tenses of finite verbs .
Present time .
The present tense is formed by adding dō , d , followed by the personal suffixes to the base or to a participle ending in pā , bā , ā , etc.
Forms such as ra-mā-d , he gives , show that the third person singular is formed by adding the personal suffix directly to the participle ; compare also pī-pā , comes ; brā~ , lives .
The latter form is identical with the base .
The participles used in the formation of the present tense can also be described as verbal nouns .
Past time .
A simple past is formed by adding ī and subjoining the personal suffixes ; thus , kū-ī-g , I said ; thā-ī-n , thou heardest ; thā-ī-ni , we , you heard .
The suffix i often coalesces with a preceding vowel in various ways ; thus , pī-g , I came ; rē~ , he gave ; lhē-r , they did ; lhē-na and lhē-n , didst .
The termination of the third person is rī , plural ra , after s-sounds ; thus , khos-ī-rī , he was found ; khos-ī-re , they were found ; roshēshī-rī , he got angry .
A compound past is formed by adding do , da ; to , ta to the base and conjugating throughout ; thus , shu-tō , I became ; shu-ton , becamest ; shu-tō ; became ; shutoni , we , you , became ; shutor , they became ; zē-da , I ate ; zē-dan , atest ; zē-dō , ate ; zē-dani , we , you , ate ; zē-dor , they ate .
The most common past tense is apparently formed by adding deg ( teg ) , etc., to the base or to a verbal noun ending in ā , pā , bā , mā , zā , ts ā , etc.
Deg is by origin a past tense of the base da , which is used as a verb substantive .
An l-suffix occurs in forms such as ī-leā , ī-lead , and ī-lī , he went ; thā-le-g , I heard , and so on .
The future is formed by adding o to the base or to the verbal noun ending in ā , etc.
The suffix of the third person singular is dō or du .
Imperative .
The imperative is formed by adding ō , u ; thus , raũ , give ; lhaō , do ; keō , leave .
A suffix do : is used instead in ādöh , come ; hādö , bring .
The base alone is apparently used in īl , go .
The verbal noun ending in pa , etc., can also be used as an imperative ; thus , dāpa , fall .
A plural imperative is formed by adding ni or ăni ; thus , ādani , come ye ; īlani , go ye .
Zauani , let us eat , is a future .
The negative imperative is formed by prefixing tha or by suffixing tha , plural thō ; thus , tha lō , do not do ; dau tha , fall not ; dāpeni thō , fall not ye .
Verbal nouns and participles .
The base alone is used as a verbal noun ; thus , drō rē~ , running gave , he ran ; kē~ zē tadan , thee-by eating is-by-thee , thou hast to eat .
A common verbal noun is formed by adding ā , pā , bā , mā , zā , ṛā , etc.
The same suffix is apparently used to form relative participles and nouns of agency ; thus , kam-lhā-zā , work doer , servant ; khosā , found .
Compare the suffixes of the case of the agent and of the terminative .
Negative verb .
The negative particle is a prefixed ma ; thus , ma ramā-der , they did not give ; ma da-g , I shall not fall .
Ma sometimes coalesces with a following vowel ; thus , mēh-g , I shall not go .
It is sometimes also suffixed ; thus , thuāsī ma , did not neglect .
The past negative tenses of ābī , to come ; ībī , to go , are formed as follows .
The negative is , in such forms , a suffix .
Among themselves the Māhlēs to some extent make use of a kind of secret language , substituting peculiar words and expressions for the common ones .
Our information about this slang , which only concerns the vocabulary , is not , however , sufficient for describing it in detail , and I therefore turn to some peculiarities of Māhlē grammar .
Mr.Bodding ’ s list , however , shows that Māhlē in this respect agrees with Standard Santālī .
The colour of vowels is sometimes apt to change , probably under the influence of neighbouring sounds .
Thus the inanimate pronominal infix ak ’ occurs as ek ’ and ak ’ .
The neutral vowels are treated as in Kārmālī .
N and l correspond to Standard ñ in the beginning of words .
Thus , nīndā , Standard ñīndā .
, night ; lūtūm , Standard ñūtūm , name .
It is dropped as in Hō in dūrup ’ and dūp ’ , sit , in which word the r .is an old infix and does not belong to the base .
Inflexion .
The declension of nouns and pronouns is mainly regular .
Dative suffixes such as kē in Nilgiri are , of course , Aryan .
Note genitive suffixes such as īch ’ and inīch ’ , and the ablative suffix ketē ; thus , ūnī-īch ’ hâpā^n , his son ; āpā^-t-inīch ’ , of the father ; mēsēt-ketē , from his sister .
Note also the dative infixes ā:ñ , to me ; ā^m , to thee , and the genitive infixes tīñ , my ; tā^m , thy ; tā : , his .
The numerals ‘ six ’ and following , and , in counting , often also the first five , are commonly Aryan loan-words .
The conjugation of verbs is also regular , though some forms have a peculiar appearance under the influence of the rules of pronunciation mentioned above .
The causative suffix is sā^ ; thus , dāl-sā^k ’ - ken-īñ , I am caused to be struck , I am struck .
’ The base hēn is also , in addition to tāhā:n , used in the formation of compound tenses ; thus , dāl-hēn-īñ , I was striking .
The present tense of finite verbs is formed by adding the suffix et ’ ; thus , dāl-et ’ - īñ , I strike .
If the base ends in a vowel , a very short e is , however , heard .
The inanimate infix ek ’ , ak ’ , etc., is apparently used much more freely than in Standard .
Compare the suffixes lak ’ and kak ’ in Standard .
The past tenses are regularly formed .
Forms such as dāl-kek ’ - īñ , I struck ; dāl-lek ’ - īñ , I had struck , show that the real suffixes of the past time are ke and le , as has already been inferred from the state of affairs in Standard Santālī .
The suffix of the perfect is aken , akan , etc., but the initial a is often dropped after vowels .
A very short a or e is , however , generally heard , and the final vowel of the base is distinctly lengthened before the suffix .
The suffix of the negative imperative is gā , to which ī is usually prefixed .
The root alone is used as a verbal noun .
Bri-no may as well , in this instance , be considered as a compound verb .
In m ’ tā ma-chom teo te , he tree to-sell cuts , he cuts down the tree to sell it , the root seems to be used as an infinitive of purpose .
Mr.Robinson mentions a suffix gē which is used in order to denote purpose .
It will be seen from this instance that the suffix gē is a suffix of the future , that tense being used to denote the purpose in Digāru as in other connected languages .
Bhē in hā~ tā-pē~ dh ā~-dī-bhē , I cooked rice eat-if , is perhaps the suffix of an adverbial participle .
Compound verbs seem to be formed by simply putting two verbs together .
They are perhaps formed by suffixing gō ( Needham ) or kwon ( Robinson ) .
Desideratives seem to be formed by adding no ; thus , according to Mr.Robinson , hā teku bri-no , I paddy to-buy-wish .
Potentiality is indicated by adding hēnē ( Needham ) or hanē ( Robinson ) .
Note the future in the last instance .
The Negative particle is a suffixed im ( Needham ) or yem , yom ( Robinson ) .
Mr.Robinson states that lum is added in the negative future and in the potential mood .
Both forms are apparently future tenses , all Mr.Robinson ’ s instances of the potential mood being in the future .
There is , therefore , probably a future suffix la , or lu , which is used before the negative .
The usual tense suffixes are sometimes dropped before the negative .
The Interrogative particle is gē .
The particle of disjunctive questions seems to be kyă ; thus , ā~ kyă ai-im kyă , are there ( any ) or are there not ?
The interrogative particle seems to be dropped when the sentence contains an interrogative pronoun .
The usual order of words is subject , object , verb .
Prefixes .
The most common otiose prefixes are ka , m , and ra .
Ka or kā occurs in nouns such as ka-mai , woman ; kā-phān , flower , etc.
Another prefix , kī , occurs before nouns of relationship ; thus , kī-pai , father ; kī-naũ , mother ; kī-kūng , grandfather , etc.
This kī is perhaps originally the possessive pronoun of the first person .
The prefix ka is commonly used in the formation of adjectives .
Compare the corresponding prefix ka or ga in Kachin , Bodo , and Nāgā languages .
M is used before nouns .
Ra is prefixed to nouns such as ra-nga , fish ; ra-mai , tail ; ra-ming , sun ; ra-mang , name .
Compare the r-suffix in forms such as Rāngkhōl ir-ming , Hallām rā-ming , name .
It is possible that different prefixes are represented in the words quoted .
A prefix ta seems to occur in words such as ta-lī , bow ; ta-lō-ī , buffalo ; ta-mang , fire-place ; ta-ming , salt , etc.
In n ’ dâr , petticoat ; nā-chī , star ; n ’ dak , belly ; n ’ kha-yeng , village , etc., we have a prefix na corresponding to Digāru and Kachin n ’ .
Nouns .
The Gender of human beings is distinguished by using different words , or by adding rōwai , male , and ka-mai , or mai , female .
The usual suffixes in the case of animals are n ’ dū , rangā , rahār , rapai , and ngālõ , male , and naũ , female .
Number .
Number is , when necessary , indicated by adding a numeral or else some word meaning ‘ many , ’ ‘ all , ’ etc.
Case .
The nominative and the accusative do not take any suffix .
The genitive is expressed by simply putting the governed before the governing noun .
Other relations are indicated by means of postpositions .
Adjectives .
Adjectives usually follow the noun they qualify .
The comparative degree is expressed by simply putting the compared noun before the adjective .
Numerals .
The numerals are given in the list of words .
They follow the noun they qualify .
The numerals 11-19 are formed by inserting mā , and , between kap , ten , and the numerals ‘ one , ’ ‘ two , ’ etc.
A suffix kâ , corresponding to kâ , in Miri and gâ in Daflā is added in Mr.Needham ’ s list .
Sung-gyep , thirty ( Robinson ) , is formed by prefixing sung , i.e., the numeral kā-sām , three , without the prefix kā , to gyep , another word for ‘ ten ’ .
Bri-si , forty , in the same way contains bri , the base of kam-brin , four , prefixed to si , ten .
Ngrün-si , fifty , seems to contain another word for ‘ five , ’ ngrüṇ Pronouns .
The personal pronouns are kī , I ; kī-thal , we ; nyâ or nâ , thou ; nâ-thal or nâ-ne-thal , you ; wē , he , she ; wē-thal or vē-thal , they .
Mr.Needham , who does not mention any plural forms , gives āngkai , he .
Demonstrative pronouns are ān , this ; wā~ ( Needham ) , phē-hai ( Robinson ) , that .
The interrogative pronouns are nyā ( Needham ) or ( hoi- ) nā ( Robinson ) , who ?
Relative clauses are formed in the same way as in Digāru .
Verbs .
Verbs do not differ for gender , number and person .
The root alone is used in order to denote the Present time ; thus , kī ndat , I call ; nyâ kāp , thou shootest ; wē gī-ār , he runs .
The suffix meng , probably a verb substantive , is sometimes added .
The usual suffixes of Past time are gā and kong ; compare Miri kā and kāng .
Kong is often used to denote a remote past , and may be translated as a perfect .
The suffix of the Future is yū or yung ; thus , kīshā-yū , I will eat ; wē kāp-yung , he will shoot .
The suffix of the Imperative is shū .
The root alone is often used ; thus , hū , come .
The negative imperative is expressed by prefixing ai to the verb .
The root alone is used as a verbal noun .
The same form is apparently also used as an infinitive of purpose .
Compound verbs .
We are only informed about the formation of the compounds denoting potentiality , in which non-niu , able , is added to the root of the principal verb .
The Negative particle is a prefixed mā .
The vowel of the negative is sometimes shortened or changed in other ways .
The Interrogative particle is ī ; compare Kachin ī .
This is the dialect spoken in Paṭṭi Byangs , in the north-eastern corner of Almora .
Two specimens and a list of Standard Words and Phrases have been prepared by Babu Gobind Prasad , B.A.
They are the only foundation of the notes on Byāngsī grammar which follow .
Byāngsī in most characteristics agrees so closely with Chaudāngsī , that it seems probable that both represent the same dialect .
I shall only mention some few features where the two dialects apparently differ .
There are no other instances of a similar interchange of vowels .
The prefixes ka and pa also have the forms kau , kab , and pab , respectively .
K and g are interchangeable in the suffix k ( ai ) or g ( ai ) ; thus , hva-k , hva-kai , leaving ; dā-gai , giving .
Such interchange between hard and soft consonants seems to show that the soft consonants are pronounced with a strong aspiration .
Aspirated soft consonants are not , however , marked in writing .
Articles .
The numeral tig , one , and the pronouns unā , khamī , and gā~ṛ , a certain , are used as an indefinite article ; thus , tig mī , a man ; khamī bā , a father ; unā mī-gai , of a man ; gā~ṛ sang-khū , in a village .
Nouns .
Gender is distinguished by using different words or by adding words denoting ‘ male , ’ ‘ female , ’ respectively .
Number .
The usual plural suffix is māng as in Chaudāngsī ; thus , chamē-māng , daughters .
Case .
The case suffixes are the same as in Chaudāngsī .
The case suffixes are sometimes dropped , and sometimes also interchanged .
Some of the most usual postpositions are khū and khū~ , in ; tī , with ; tī-jōrū and tī-rakt , together with ; biī , with ; gundā , between ( also added to the genitive ) ; jā-ṭī , on ; khar-chī , from ; yar , on , which are usually added to the base .
Others are combined with the genitive of the governed word .
Such are bhitarū , inside ; dāng-sai , dāngchī , for the sake of ( also added to the base ) ; ikhū and yēkhũ , under ( also added to the base ) ; khai , instead of ; larē , before ; nēṛō , near ; nigam , behind ; nintam , after , and so on .
Adjectives .
Adjectives precede the noun they qualify in the nominative .
Forms such as tha-id , high ; rukhsit , like , etc., contain the suffix id which is also used to form participles .
Another common suffix in adjectives is th or tha ; thus , va-th , far ; chin-th , proper ; syāng-tha , old .
The particle of comparison is chyāng , chyāng-rī , or chyā-rī ; thus , u-chyāng dōmā bud , him-from a-little good , better ; u-g pī vō rangsyā-chyāng-rī bung-tha-in , his brother his sister-from tall-is ; lai-chyāng-rī bud and lai-chyā-rī bud , all from good , best .
Numerals .
The numerals will be found in the list of words .
They precede the word they qualify ; thus , nīsī sirī , two sons .
Pronouns .
The following are the personal pronouns : Other forms occurring in the materials are , jiyē and ji lai , we ; gayē , you ; ing-gai , his ; vō , his ; apī and apī-gai , own , and so forth .
Jiyē , we , and gayē , you , apparently contain the demonstrative pronoun yē , this ; ji lai , we , literally means ‘ I all ’ .
Demonstrative pronouns are ai , aidī , yē , nē , this ; ati , vaii , dai , that .
Than in than-jyā , to-day , is probably also a demonstrative pronoun .
Interrogative pronouns are khamī , who ?
They are often used as indefinite pronouns ; thus , khamī , some ; unā , a certain .
Relative pronouns have been borrowed from Aryan forms of speech .
sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the word or sentence it qualifies .
The Aryan relatives have not , however , become naturalized in the dialect , and we often find relative clauses expressed by means of interrogative pronouns or by juxtaposition .
Verbṣ Byāngsī conjugation in most particulars agrees with Chaudāngsī .
The reduplication is less frequent , but still common enough to be considered a characteristic feature of the dialect ; thus , rū-rū-tā , asked ; dī-dī-nī , went ; si-syung-tā , did .
There is apparently a similar tendency as in Chaudāngsī to distinguish the second person by adding an n ; thus , lhī-nō , art , you are ; da-nan-sō , gavest .
Similar forms are , however , also used in other persons ; thus , ma-da-nan , he did not give ; tōk-tā-tanan , he is grazing ; sa-n-sō , we struck , and so forth .
It seems as if the tendency to distinguish the person of the subject in the verb is less pronounced than in Chaudāngsī .
Verb substantive .
The verb substantive is formed from various bases such as lī or lhī , nī , in ; dai , and perhaps also tā , id , an , and yē .
The base tā seems to mean ‘ to remain ’ .
It seems to be used in the first person singular only .
Finite verb .
The various bases of the verb substantive are freely used in the formation of the tenses of finite verbs .
Present time .
The usual suffix of the present tense is tā , first person tū , tō , second person tan .
The suffix tan of the second person probably contains a pronominal suffix .
Compare tin-tan-an , they get , where a suffix an , probably abbreviated from anī , another form of the copula , has been added .
The suffix an or anō is apparently added to the participle ending in g or k in the common present forms ending in gan or kan ; thus , chhyū-kan , I shall get ; dī-ganō , thou goest ; rā-gan , he comes .
The suffix yē is apparently only used in the first person ; thus , lhī-yē , I am ; hi-chi-yē , I die .
Past time .
The present tense is often used with the meaning a past ; thus , luk-tā , he said ; ma da-nan , he did not give ; jā-gan , they are ; chōk-phang-ganī , fled back ; ma tar-nī , could not , and probably also forms such as syōng-tinan , they made ; lakṭap-tī-tā , he applied , and so forth .
The common suffix of the past is s or sō , sū , sau ; thus , nī-sō , was ; rā-sō , came ; ṭāl-sū , I transgressed ; ting-sau , he got .
In the second person we find forms such as sa-n-s , struckest ; di-n-sō , wentest ; da-nan-sō , gavest .
The suffix s , sō , etc., is sometimes also added to the suffix yē or to a suffix g , k ; thus , di-yē-sō , I have walked ; di-ya-sō , they went ; gvausi-yē-sō , they made merry ; sa-k-sō , I struck ; dā-ka-s , I gave .
The latter kind of forms only occur in the first person .
The s-suffix is sometimes also added to sī or tī ; thus , yāng-sī-sō , heard ; ya-kvak-tī-sō , devoured .
Past tenses are further formed from the reduplicated base , or from the base preceded by one of the prefixes pa , pab , pi , and ka , kab , kau , or kō , usually by adding one of the suffixes tā , nī , and sō .
It is probably the suffix of a conjunctive participle , compare thog-sī , returning .
Future .
The present is commonly used as a future .
The suffix nō , lō , nē probably contains the verb substantive lī or nī .
The form luk-vō , I shall say , contains a suffix ō or vō .
Imperative .
The base alone is used as an imperative ; thus , jā , eat ; dī , go ; dā , give .
Common imperative suffixes are nī , tī , and yō ; thus , tā-nī , put ; rai-nī , bring ; dā-tī , give ; kōr-yō , take ; gī-yō , bind ; hvangi-yō , draw .
There are no instances in the materials available of a negative imperative .
Verbal nouns .
The common suffix used in forming verbal nouns is mō , or m ; thus , jā-mō , to eat ; pā-mȭ-gai , of the measuring ; lō-m , to say .
The base alone is often used as a verbal noun , especially in connexion with post-position ; thus , rāng , to sell ; tung-khū , drinking-in , in order to drink ; dī-dī-ma-chī , from the going , having gone ; thok-s-ig rā-lā~ng , back coming-on , on returning ; pa-lāng-rē , on knowing .
Such forms are commonly used as conjunctive or adverbial participles .
An infinitive of purpose can be formed by adding dung or rang ; thus , dī-dung , in order to go ; pa-tnan-rāng , in order to know ; syung-am-rang , in order to make .
Relative and verbal participles are formed by adding the suffix id or d to the base or to the suffix s of the past .
Conjunctive participles are formed by adding sī ; thus , thōg-sī , returning .
The reduplicated base is used in the same way ; thus , pa-pā , having measured .
Most commonly , however , conjunctive participles are formed by adding the suffix of the genitive to the verbal noun which is identical with the base ; thus , yang-gai , hearing ; hōng-kai , having taken out ; ra-k , bringing .
The form ending in sī is used as a verbal noun of the past , and the suffix of the genitive is added ; thus , yāng-si-g-an , having wished was , wished .
Compare the remarks under the head of the present time above .
Other conjunctive participles are formed by adding the suffix of the ablative chī or chū to the reduplicated verbal noun ending in m ; thus , nī-nī-mi-chī , having been ; dī-dī-ma-chī , having gone ; ni-nyar-ma-chū , having been lost , and so forth .
Passive voice .
There is no passive voice .
Passivity is indicated by the absence of the case of the agent in the subject .
There are no certain instances to show how causatives are formed .
Negative particle .
The negative particle is a prefixed ma ; thus , ma dai , I am not ; ma da-nan , did not give ; ma rā-sō , did not come .
Order of words .
The order of words is the same as in Chaudāngsī .
The estimated number of speakers of the Māwchī dialect is 30 , 000 .
Māwchī is a dialect of Gujarātī Bhīlī of the same kind as Chōdhrī , D#ōḍiā , Gāmtī , Rānī Bhil , etc.
The short a has the same broad pronunciation as in other Bhīl dialects .
An h between vowels is usually very faintly sounded and is often dropped .
In such cases the vowels separated by the h may be contracted .
Thus , tōhō , tōō , and tō , thy ; tyāhā , tyāā , and tyā , his ; ēhĩ , ahĩ , and ē~ , I .Vowels are very commonly nasalized .
An r is usually dropped between vowels ; thus , kōĩ , having done ; mōũ , I may die ; dūu ; far ; bōhĩ , i.e.
Nouns .
There are only two genders , the masculine and the feminine .
Strong masculine bases end in ō or ā , plural ā or ē ; thus , pōhō or pōhā , a son ; plural pōhā or pōhē .
The plural of other masculine bases usually ends in ē ; thus , ḍōgᵃrē , cattle ; ḍukᵃrē~ , pigs ; māhē , men .
Strong feminine bases end in ī , plural iā or iō ; thus , pōhī , a daughter ; plural , pōhiā or pōhiō ; ghōḍī , a mare ; plural ghōḍiā , etc.
The oblique form agrees with Gujarātī .
Often , however , it is formed from the genitive ; thus , pōhiē , of a daughter ; pōhiēl , to a daughter ; ābōhōl , to a father , etc.
The cases are the same as in Gujarātī .
The nominative is sometimes used instead of the case of the agent to denote the subject when the verb is the past tense of a transitive verb .
The suffix of the case of the agent is ē , ē~ or hē , hē~ ; thus .
The suffix of the dative is n , l or lā ; thus , ābōhōl , to the father ; pōhāl , to the son ; māhū-lā , to a man ; pōyᵃrā-hān , to the sons .
The ablative is formed by adding nē ; thus , rānā-māy-nē , from in the fields .
The suffix of the genitive is hō or ō .
The final vowel of the suffix is treated , in accordance with the rules for the inflexion of strong bases , as in an adjective .
The suffix of the locative is mā~ , māy , or mē ; thus , mulukhā-mā~ , in the country ; rānā-māy , in the fields ; gahā~-mē , in the house .
Pronouns .
The following are the personal pronouns : Demonstrative pronouns are ō , fem .
The interrogative pronouns are kũ or kō , who ?
Verbs .
The present tense of the verb substantive is , Or hē , hai , throughout .
The past tense is regular , singular hatō , etc., plural hatā or hatē , etc.
The old present is used as a conjunctive present , an ordinary present , a past , and , after the negative mā~ , as a negative imperative .
The ordinary present is also used in the last mentioned way .
The old present is regularly formed .
The present tense of finite verbs is formed as follows .
In the singular we also find forms such as jātō-hō , I go , thou goest , he goes ; and in the plural jāhũ , we go ; jāhā~ , you go ; jāhā~ or jā~ , they go .
The past tense is formed as in connected dialects by adding yō ( ō ) , nō , lō , etc.
The ordinary future of ṭhōkᵃnō , to beat , is , Other forms are dēĩ , I shall give ; rōhī , I shall be ; kōhũ , we shall make .
The plural of the imperative ends in ā as in Khāndēśī ; thus , dā , give ye ; ghālā , put ye .
Other forms will be easily recognized as identical with those occurring in other Bhīl dialects .
Mr.Simcox remarks that the native who prepared the texts for him has to some extent been influenced by Marāthī , the official language of the district .
Their language differs considerably from Angāmi and Semā , but clearly belongs to the same sub-group .
I have not found any authority which deals with this people or their language .
The following account of the principal peculiarities of Kezhāmā grammar is based on the specimens which have been now made available for the first time .
I can only therefore say that the following appear to be the noteworthy points of the grammar .
Nouns have a prefix e , corresponding to the Semā and Rengmā ā , which was originally the pronoun of the third person and means ‘ his , ’ but often has the force only of the definite article , or even has no meaning whatever , as in e-nē me-chü , a distant town .
Corresponding to the Angāmi relative suffix u , we have o , as in kachü-o , he who was the younger .
In nouns , the nominative singular takes the suffix nyi before transitive verbs , corresponding to the Lhōtā nā .
As in that language , the suffix can be omitted when no ambiguity will ensue .
The genitive , as in other cognate languages , takes no termination , and precedes the governing noun , as in su : e-nē mi kelē kē , that town ’ s man one ’ s house , the house of a man of that town .
The dative takes the suffix nhà , as in e-pfü-nhà , to his father .
The locative takes chē , as in e-l ă - chē , in the field , and àzo means ‘ with , ’ as in krokromu-àzo , with harlots .
The sign of the plural is , as in Angāmi , ko .
As regards pronouns , we have the following forms , Yē or iyē , I ; āwu-ko , we .
The word vē means ‘ property , ’ as in ā-vē , my property , but is also used to give the force of various cases to the personal pronouns , as in ā-vē , with me .
Ā , by itself , is used as a prefix meaning ‘ my , ’ as in ā-pfü , my father .
No , ‘ thou ’ and ‘ you ’ ; used as a prefix i means ‘ thy , ’ as in i-pfü , thy father ; i-vē , thy property , with thee ; no i-rē , means ‘ thy son ’ .
The prefix is e or pu , as in e-pfü , his father ; pu-vē , his property .
The nominative before transitive verbs is pu-nyi .
As to verbs , we have bā , is , was .
Adjectives take verbal terminations , as in vē-ā , it is good .
The present tense in the list of words is not very clear , but it is probably meant that yē-nyi dā , means ‘ I beat ’ .
The usual suffix of the past tonse is nā , as in psü-nā , gave ; chü-nā , as well as chü , did .
Another suffix is ā or wā , as in pu-ā , said ; gwo-ā , has come ; me-lho-wā , has given food .
Finally , there are several instances in which no suffix is used , as in the present .
The suffix of the future is dà , as in pu-dà , will say ; e-nyi-d à , will be happy .
The suffix of the imperative seems to be nē , as in psü-nē , give .
The usual suffix of the conjunctive participle is ngi , as in ngu-ngi , seeing .
The causal suffix , corresponding to the Angāmi bu , is probably lâ , as in pu-ē-lă mā-pfu-lo , cause him to wear .
Their language is so closely related to Rāngkhōl and Hallām that I do not hesitate to identify it with the Langrong mentioned by Mr.Soppitt .
No specimens have been received , but the numerals have been taken down in several parts of the district , and in two cases , they agree with the forms given in the Tipperah list , while two other lists apparently belong to Hallām and Thādo respectively .
Campbell , Sir George , Specimens of Languages of India , including those of the Aboriginal Tribes of Bengal , the Central Provinces and the Eastern Frontier .
Soppitt , C .A ., A Short Account of the Kuki Lushai Tribes on the North-East Frontier ( Districts Cachar , Sylhet , Năga Hills , etc., and the North Cachar Hills ) , with an Outline Grammar of the Rangkhol-Lushai Language and A Comparison of Lushai with other Dialects .
The following remarks on Langrong , which are based on the materials just mentioned , are the first attempt to describe this language , and are given with every reserve .
For instance , ra^ and rō , the suffix of the imperative ; tlai and ṭlē , to run ; pai , pē , and pēk , to give .
Consonants are occasionally silent ; thus , phāk and phā , to eat .
A consonant is sometimes doubled ; thus , allā or ālā , far ; ommā or a^m ā , being , etc.
The numeral khāt , one , is used as an indefinite article , and demonstrative pronouns or relative clauses supply the place of a definite article .
Nouns .
Gender .
Gender is only apparent in the case of animate beings .
In other cases suffixes are used to denote the gender .
In the case of animals the male suffix is chal , and the female pūi .
The suffix of the plural is hēi ; thus , ṭēn-hēi , friends .
The Nominative , the Accusative , and the Dative do not take any suffix .
The subject of a transitive verb is usually distinguished by the suffix in , denoting the agent .
The verb may be a participle or an infinitive ; thus va^k-in phāk-nā ka^k , the pigs-by eaten husks .
The Genitive is expressed by putting the stem , without any suffix , or repeated by means of a pronoun , before the governing noun ; thus , nang-mā pā nāi , thy father ’ s sons ; mā sā-kor ā-kūm ī-jā-kā-ma^ , this horse its years how-many ?
The suffix tā is sometimes added ; thus , kai-mā pā-tā lō-mūnā sēla^-hēi , my father ’ s hired servants .
The Locative is formed by means of the suffixes ā and in .
Other postpositions used to denote the various relations of nouns are .
Adjectives .
Adjectives usually follow the noun they qualify , and suffixes are then added to them and not to the qualified noun .
The suffix of comparison is nēk-in or ning-in .
Numerals .
The numerals are given in the list of words .
They follow the noun they qualify .
Pā in pā-kāt , one , etc., is probably a generic particle .
Pronouns .
The following are the Personal pronouns , to which the ordinary suffixes may be added : To these forms must be added the pronominal prefixes used before verbs .
The plural forms are kāin , nāin , and ān-in or ān , and these may probably also be used as possessive pronouns with nouns and postpositions .
The following Demonstrative pronouns occur : Hā , this ; hi , this ; mā , that ; sa^ , that ; mā-hi , that , he .
Relative pronouns .
Participles and verbal nouns are used in relative clauses ; thus , va^k-in phāk-nā ka^k , pigs-by eaten husks ; mā ha^ng-tik-in , he coming-time-at .
Interrogative pronounṣ Tū-ma^ , who ?
Indefinite pronounṣ Īkā , any ; tū-kha^m , anyone .
Verbs .
Verbs may be conjugated in person and number by means of pronominal prefixes .
The use of these prefixes is very inconsistent , and they are often dropped .
The root alone , without any suffix , is freely used to denote present and past times .
The suffix of Past tenses is tā ; thus , kai-mān kē hem-tā , I struck ; ān pā-in ā-ni mū-tā , his father him saw .
The suffix of the Future is ding ; thus , kai-mā tha^-in kē pā nēng-ā kāl-ding , I arising my father-to go-will .
The suffix of the Imperative is rō or ra^ ; thus , pē-rō , give ; choy-ra^ , bring , draw ; būn-tir-rō , to-wear-cause you .
A first person plural is formed by means of the suffix rang , probably a suffix of the future .
The simplest form of the Infinitive or Verbal Noun seems to be the root alone .
A common suffix is nā ; thus , kāl-nā , to go ; phāk-nā , to eat , food .
It will be observed that this form is constantly given in the list of words to translate the verbal roots .
Infinitives of purpose are formed with the suffixes ding and rang ; thus , hal-nā-ding-in , grazing-for ; phūng-kha^f-ding ning-tā , belly-fill-for 
The same meaning has the verbal noun ending in nā ; thus , va^k-in phāk-nā ka^k , pigs-by eaten husks ; mā ja^l-ā a^m-nā mi , that country-in residing man .
The suffix i-lā is used to form a Conjunctive participle ; thus , bāk-ilā pē-rō , dividing give .
The locative suffixes ā and in form Conjunctive and Adverbial participles .
There is no Passive voice .
The suffix in after the subject of a transitive verb denotes the active .
But its use is somewhat inconsistent , and its absence does not , therefore , always show that the verb is in the passive voice .
Compound verbs .
No prefixes occur in the specimens .
Causatives are formed by means of the verb tir ; thus , kāl-tir , to cause to go , to send .
Desideratives are formed by adding na^m , to wish ; thus , kāl-na^m-māk , to-go-wished-not .
Other words used as the last part of compound verbs are .
The Negative particle is māk ; thus , kāl-na^m-māk , to-go-wished-not .
Another negative , na , occurs twice after pē , to give ; thus , pē-na , gave not .
A third negative , lai , occurs in ā-ṭhā-lai , good-not , bad ; ai-lai , obey-not ; ai-lai-ā , disobeying , against .
The Interrogative particle is ma^ or mō ; thus , tū-nēng-ā ma^ , whom from ?
See also Interrogative pronouns , above .
The tribe seems to have immigrated into its present habitat some 150 years ago , and their language shows that they have come from Western India .
Note on a Dialect of Gujarātī discovered in the District of Midnapur .
Siyālgirī is derived from a dialect closely related to Gujarātī-Bhīlī , and the tribe has probably originally come from the border districts between Central India , Rajputana , and the Bombay Presidency , the stronghold of the Bhīl tribes .
On their way towards the east they have come into contact with various tribes , and the results can be traced in their speech , which now presents a mixed appearance though the original base is easily recognizable .
The materials are not sufficient to solve all the problems connected with the dialect .
In many Bhīl dialects an s is regularly replaced by a sound which is something between s and h , somewhat like the ch in German ‘ ach ’ .
Thus , khab for sab , all ; dēkh for dēs , country ; khāmlōyā-n , Gujarātī sā~bhalᵃwũ , to hear ( compare hāmᵃlīnē , having heard , in the Bhīl dialects of Jhabua and Kotra ) ; barakh , Gujarātī varas , a year ; khāk-hāun having become awakened ( compare hamki , thought , in the Bhīl dialect of Ratlam ) .
It is , however , probable that it is pronounced in the same way as in other Bhīl dialects .
I have therefore substituted the sign kh for the kh of the original .
A cerebral d.between vowels is pronounced as an ṛ , as is also the case in other Bhīl dialects ; thus , thōṛā , few .
The same change is common in many Bhīl dialects , but may also be due to the influence of eastern vernaculars .
V is sometimes dropped before i and ē , as is usually the case in many Bhīl dialects and in the Marāṭhī of Berar and the Central Provinces .
Nouns .
The various genders are constantly confounded .
The plural seems to have the same form as the singular .
With regard to cases , the case of the agent is never used .
The subject of transitive verbs is put in the nominative case even when the verb is a passive form .
The nominative singular of strong masculine bases ends in ā as in Marāṭhī and eastern vernaculars ; thus , dikrā , a son .
Traces of the Gujarātī termination ō are , however , found in the adjectives ; thus , mōṭō dīkrā , the big ( i.e.
The usual case suffixes are as follows .
It will be seen that an oblique base ending in ā seems to occur in some of these forms .
Most of the suffixes just mentioned occur in other Bhīl dialects .
The locative suffix mō and the dative suffix kō are perhaps borrowed from Rājasthānī or some eastern dialect .
Similar forms , however , also occur in the speech of other Bhīl tribes .
Adjectives .
There is no fixed rule for the inflexion of adjectives .
Pronouns .
This form also occurs in some Bhīl dialects .
The suffix of the dative of pronouns is hē ; thus , minhē or manhē , to me .
The dative suffix hē is common in some Bhīl dialects .
It corresponds to a genitive suffix hō as nē corresponds to the genitive ending in nō .
The genitive suffix hō occurs in forms such as tũhu āgal , before thee ; inhā hāthē , on his hand , etc.
To the genitive māra , my , corresponds a dative māra , to me .
It will be seen that the various dative suffixes correspond to genitives formed by adding the same suffix with another termination .
The three pairs of suffixes also occur in other Bhīl dialects .
‘ Thou ’ is tu , genitive tũhu , tār , and tē-rā .
The demonstrative pronouns seem to be derived from various sources .
The forms tinha and inha are perhaps originally the case of the agent .
Verbs .
There is apparently no difference between the singular and the plural .
Of the verb substantive the following forms occur , raha , thou art ; thā , it is ; hutā , he was ; thēi , they were .
The conjunctive present is used both as a present and as a past ; thus , maru , I die ; kahē , he said ; rahē , he lived ; jāi kō-ni , he would not go .
The same is the case with the ordinary past ; thus , āvya , he came ; dikrā kahā , the-son ( - by ) it-was said ; hĩksha didhu , the share was given ; giya , he went ; lāgā , they went ; jō tār khābja khādu , who ate thy property , etc.
The future is formed as in Gujarātī-Bhīlī ; thus , kahis , I shall say .
It is , however , possible that the final n in such forms corresponds to the n in the past tense of Khāndēśī and some Bhīl dialects .
Compare lāgīn , he began , they began , etc., in the Naikᵃḍī dialect of Surat .
The negative particle is kō-ni , not .
The same form occurs in some Rājasthānī and Bhīl dialects .
The inflexion of Siyālgirī is , as the preceding remarks will have shown , mainly the same as in Gujarātī-Bhīlī .
Compare āgā , father ( probably the Turkī āghā , master , borrowed through Hindustānī ) ; badi-thēi , against ; ba-bhain , thereupon ; ēlā-tō , then ( probably the ablative of the base contained in Māwᵃchī ēlō , that ) ; chhēya ( perhaps a corruption of the Bengali chēyē ) in darkār ghanu chhēya khādu , more food than necessary ; dayā-bahi , pitying ( perhaps , compassion having flowed ) ; lāsin , having run ; uṇḍēl , neck , etc.
The general question of the Gūjars and their language has been dealt with at length in the General Introduction to the Pahāṛī languages ( ante , pp .
Suffice it to say here that while the Gūjars of the Panjab plains have lost their language and adopted that of their neighbours , those of the hills north of the Panjab , who are called Gujurs not Gūjars speak a language closely allied to Rājasthānī .
I have also given short specimens of the mongrel language spoken by the Gūjars of the sub-montane Districts of the Panjab , where they have not entirely adopted the local language of their neighbours .
On former occasions I have drawn attention to the fact that Gujurī is little more than a dialect of Rājasthānī , and I have more than once stated that its closest relation was the Mēwāṛī dialect of that language .
Mēwātī is the language of the Mēōs , a tribe the origin of which has been much discussed by ethnologists , without coming to any satisfactory result .
Possibly , the close connexion between their language and Gujurī may offer a clue that has hitherto been neglected .
It will further be noted that in many cases , when a word is common to the two languages , Gujurī always preserves it in a form more archaic than that found in Mēwātī .
Thus : In all these the Gujurī forms are more archaic than those of Mēwātī .
In the Gujurī trē , an r has been preserved which has been lost in Mēwātī , and in the case of the word for ‘ I ’ , Mēwātī has lost the old nominative , preserved by Gujurī , and has substituted the oblique form exactly as has occurred in Standard Hindōstānī .
In the declension of nouns , the two languages closely resemble each other , as will be seen from the following examples .
It is only in the feminine plurals that there are any differences , and even these are slight : 
The postpositions used to form cases are practically identical .
Thus : In both dialects the genitive postposition is an adjectival kō , obl .
In both , when agreeing with a postposition or noun in the locative masculine it becomes kē .
In Gujurī , perhaps under the influence of Pañjābī , the feminine kī becomes kī~ when agreeing with a plural feminine noun .
The Personal Pronouns closely resemble each other .
In the oblique singular of both persons and in the nominative singular of the first person , it will be seen that the Gujurī forms are preserved better by Mēwāṛī than by Mēwātī .
Personal Pronouns .
The remaining pronouns are identical in the plural , but exhibit divergencies in the singular oblique forms .
Possibly , the Gujurī singular oblique forms have been borrowed from the neighbouring dialects of the Indus Kōhistān or from Pañjābī .
At the same time , note how , in the nominative singular , both Gujurī and Mēwātī have feminine forms for the demonstrative pronouns .
The agreement in regard to the Verb Substantive is very striking : Active Verb .
As regards the active verb the agreement is also striking .
Especially noteworthy is the agreement as to the formation of the future by adding gō .
In most Rājasthānī dialects as well as in Western Pahāṛī , the typical sign of the future is usually lō , or some related form , not gō .
These two tenses are much the same in all Indo-Aryan languages , but in both the above we have the typical Rājasthānī first person plural in ā~ .
In both Gujurī and Mēwātī the future is formed as in Hindī by suffixing gō ( pl .
The other parts of the verb are similarly parallel .
Thus : The Definite present is formed in both by adding the verb substantive to the simple present , and not to the present participle .
The Past tenses are as usual formed from the Past Participle , which , in the case of transitive verbs , is construed passively .
From the above it will be seen that Gujurī Grammar is practically the same as that of Mēwātī .
We now proceed to consider the Grammar of Gujurī alone , in greater detail .
We have not , however , any information about the number of speakers .
Compare tin , classical Tibetan bdun , seven ; song and sing , the suffix of past time ; su and si , who ?
With regard to consonants it should be noted that the sounds j , dz , z , and zh are not correctly distinguished in the specimens .
The intermediate form , with an aspirated hard initial , occurs in phu , son .
On the other hand , hard initials are occasionally softened when preceded by vowels or nasals in compound words ; thus , tham-je , classical thams-chad , all .
With regard to final consonants g is usually changed to k , and b to p ; thus , chik , one ; phak , swine ; lep , arrive .
Final d is dropped and the preceding vowel is modified so that a becomes e ( i.e., probably a : ) , o becomes e , o , or oe , i.e., probably ö , etc.
Final n seems to exercise a similar influence on a preceding vowel .
Compare the suffix of the present participle ken or kin , Ladakhī mkhan .
A preceding vowel is modified , and probably lengthened ; thus , le , i.e., lā : , classical las , from ; nyī , classical gnyis , two .
In compound consonants containing a subscribed y as second component in classical Tibetan , this y is dropped before i and e ; thus , khi , classical khyi , dog ; pe , classical byed , do .
In other compounds the first consonant is dropped ; thus , lang , classical glang , bull ; lep , classical sleb , arrive ; kang-ba , classical rkang-ba , foot ; ta , classical rta , horse ; che , classical lche , tongue ; ke , classical skad , sound ; tong-bu , classical sdong-po , tree ; nang , classical gnang , give ; ngul , classical dngul , silver ; tin , i.e., tün , classical bdun , seven , and so forth .
The numeral chik , one , is used as an indefinite , and the demonstrative pronoun di , this , as a definite article ; thus , mi chik , a man ; angsha-di , the share .
Nouns Gender .
Gender is distinguished by using different words or by adding qualifying affixes ; thus , no , brother ; nu-mu , sister : pu , son ; po-mo , daughter : ta-bu , horse ; ta-mu , mare .
Number .
The usual suffix of the plural is kya ; thus , aba-kya , fathers ; compare cha in Ḍänjong-kä .
The suffix of the genitive is i , ki , or gi after vowels , and i or ki after consonants .
The same form is also used as a case of the agent .
The definite article is often added in the genitive ; thus , aba chik-i-di , of a father .
Di is used alone as a genitive suffix in po-mu-di , of daughters .
Other cases are formed by adding suffixes such as la , in , to ; sa-le , from the place of , from ; minji , minjik , min-zi , min-zik , from ; dung-la , before , etc.
Adjectives sometimes precede and sometimes follow the noun they qualify .
The particle of comparison is the Naipālī bhanda ; thus , kho-i a-zi bhanda no rim-bu-du , his sister than brother tall-is , his brother is taller than his sister .
The following are the personal pronouns : The pronouns are inflected like nouns .
Other pronouns are di , this ; o and o-di , that ; su , who ?
The usual bases of the verb substantive are e and du .
In the past tense we find woe .
Finite verb .
The verb is still virtually a noun .
The subject of transitive verbs is put in the case of the agent , and the plural suffix kya can be added .
Present time .
A present is formed by adding yin to a participle ending in ka , pa , etc.
A compound present is formed by adding gu or ku , or , after vowels , u , and the verb substantive ; thus , chho-u-du , he is feeding ; kho-i rob-ku-du , he strikes ; te-ku-e , he lives ; ong-gu du-ba , he is coming .
Du-ba , is , in the last instance contains the usual suffix of the participle ; compare also ye-ba , they are .
To in rob-to , they strike , is probably the copula du .
Past time .
The participle ending in ba or pa is commonly also used as a past tense , especially in the second person ; thus , nyo-ba , I brought , thou broughtest ; kal-pa , wentest ; se-pa , killedest .
The most common past tense is formed by adding song , or , usually , sing , ( i.e., probably süng ) ; thus , gal-song and kal-sing , he went .
The common present is also used as a past ; thus , e-kin , i.e.
Future .
The present is also used as a future ; thus , don , I will go ; lap-ken , I will say ; ong-do , I shall be .
Imperative .
As in classical Tibetan , an a is often changed to o in the imperative ; thus , song , go ; so , eat ; long , stand .
The unaltered base is used in forms such as shi , die ; do , go ; ter , give .
Sometimes we find suffixes added such as kong , tong , dung , and ter ; thus , rob-kong ( i.e.
Verbal nouns and participles .
The most common verbal noun is formed by adding che , or , after vowels , ze ; thus , lap-che , to say ; do-ze , to go .
A suffix a occurs in charai-te-ya-la , in order to feed .
Relative participles are formed by adding ken or gen and ba .
The interrogative pronoun kan-di , which ?
Adverbial participles are formed by adding postpositions to the base ; thus , lap-na , saying-in , if you say ; ong-a-te-su , arriving-after , when he came .
Conjunctive participles are formed by adding di , ti , or di-ma-rang ; thus , rob-sing-di , having beaten ; kal-di-ma-rang , having gone .
Ma-rang is a postposition which governs the genitive .
It is therefore also added to the genitive of the base ; thus , sing-i-ma-rang , having been .
Negative particle .
The negative particle is a prefixed me or ma ; thus , kal-di me-ken , going not-were , did not go ; me-ter-ekin , not-giving-was , did not give ; ma-nyin , 
It will be seen that mat sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the verb .
I am indebted to Major J .Shakespear , C.I.E., ḌS.O., I.S.C., for a translation of the Parable of the Prodigal Son in Mhār , and this translation is the basis of the following attempt to describe the chief characteristics of the language .
There are no signs used in the specimen to denote long vowels , but we may infer from Lushēi that final vowels of words and syllables are long .
An h after a vowel indicates that the sound is abruptly shortened .
But the specimen is not consistent in the use of this h , and there seems to be some confusion also in other respects , especially with regard to the vowels o and a^ , which latter sign denotes the sound of a in the English word ‘ all ’ .
Concurrent vowels are occasionally contracted ; thus , pan for pa-in , by the father .
A euphonic v is inserted between o and a following vowel ; thus , deo-v-in , lo-v-a .
Articles .
There are no articles in the language .
In the first sentence of the specimen the indefinite pronoun tu-ma-nih , a certain , is used as an indefinite article , while pronominal prefixes , demonstrative pronouns , and relative phrases supply the place of a definite article .
Nouns .
Gender is only apparent in the case of animate nouns .
The specimen contains two suffixes denoting gender , pa and pa-sal , both for the masculine gender .
Names of animals seem to be neuter when no suffix denotes their gender .
Thus vok , pigs , is combined with the singular pronominal prefix .
See Verbs , below .
Number .
There are two numbers , the singular and the plural .
The number of the subject is indicated by means of the pronominal prefixes preceding the verb .
When it is necessary to indicate the plural the suffix hai is added ; thus , suak-hai , slaves .
Hai is identical with the plural suffix used in Rāngkhōl , Langrong , Chiru , etc.
Case .
The Nominative , the Accusative and the Dative are not distinguished by means of suffixes .
The Genitive is denoted by putting the stem , without any suffix , before the governing word ; thus , ro ka chan-tum , of the property my share .
In nang-a mit-mhu , your eye-sight , a is suffixed to the pronoun .
This a is the demonstrative pronoun of the third person ; so also van-a mi , sky-its man , God , etc.
The suffix in , denoting the agent , is added to the subject of a transitive verb ; thus , a pa-n ( i.e., pa-in ) , 
Tu-ma-nih is the indefinite pronoun , and na seems to correspond to the Manipurī suffix na .
Adjectives .
Adjectives follow the noun they qualify , and postpositions are added to them and not to the qualified noun ; thus , khua-lam la-tak-a , village far-very-to .
The suffix of the comparative is lem ; thus , nao-pang lem , younger ; a-len lem , bigger .
The superlative seems to be marked by adding tak , very ; thus , puan tha tak , cloth good very , the best cloth .
Numerals .
The numerals follow the word they qualify .
Pa-khat is ‘ one ’ and pa-nhih , two , both formed with the generic prefix pa .Other numerals do not occur .
Pronouns .
The following Personal pronouns occur : Singular , Plural , The forms ka , i-ni , i , an , a ; kan , an , are used as pronominal prefixes with verbs , see below .
The following Demonstrative pronouns seem to occur , an , an chu , this ; hi , hi hi , this ; chu , chu chun , chu-hai chun , that ; kha , ha , that .
There are no Relative pronouns .
The demonstrative pronoun is used as a kind of correlative .
A relative clause may also be formed by means of the noun of agency .
An Interrogative pronoun is ia-ma , what ?
The following Indefinite pronouns occur : tu-ma-nih , a certain ; iang-tin , some ; ziang-tin , whatever ; tu-khom , anyone ; iang-khom , anything ; hai-khom , any .
Verbs .
Verbs are conjugated in person and number by means of pronominal prefixes .
When the subject is a neuter noun , the singular particle is also used in the plural .
After tu-khom , anyone , the plural particle is used ; thus , tu-khom-in an-pe-noh-a , anyone they gave not .
The prefix of the second person singular seems to be i-ni in i-ni pek-ngai-noh , thou to-give-consideredst-not .
Ni is , however , perhaps a verbal prefix .
Prefixes are dropped before the imperative and when the subject is an interrogative pronoun .
the-big-more fields-in was , the omission seems only to be apparent , the prefix a having been fused into one sound witn the a of lo-v-a .
The root alone is used to denote present and past tenses ; thus , a ni , he is ; a ta , he said .
The suffix a , probably a verb substantive , may be added .
The suffix of Past tenses is ta or tah ; thus , a fe-tah , he went .
A kind of Perfect is effected by adding the verb substantive ; thus , a hong-rhing-nok a ni , he came-alive-again it is , he has come alive again .
In the case of transitive verbs this mode of expression may convey the idea of passivity .
In lha-tak-a a-la-om-lai-in , far-very he-was-time-at , a prefix la seems to give the force of the past time .
The Future is formed by inserting the pronominal prefix between the root and the verb tih .
The suffix of the Imperative is roh , or ro , used both in the singular and in the plural ; thus , pe-roh , give ; that-ro , kill you .
A first person plural is formed by prefixing ei to the future suffix tih ; thus , bak-ei-tih , let us eat .
196 and f.The root alone is also used as an Infinitive or Verbal noun .
The pronominal prefix indicating the person may be prefixed .
The suffix ding , or ding-in , is used to form an infinitive of purpose .
In la^m-na-ding , for rejoicing , this suffix is added to a verbal noun ending in na .
A Participle used to replace the first of two connected imperatives is formed by adding the suffix la or lan , to which a pronominal element , denoting the person to which the participle refers , is prefixed .
Conjunctive and Adverbial participles are formed by adding the locative suffixes a and in .
A Noun of agency is formed by means of the suffix tu ; thus , i nao-pasal i sum bak-ral-vong-tu , thy son thy property ate-up-all-who .
See Relative pronouns , above .
There is no Passive voice .
Compound verbs are formed by means of prefixes or by suffixing other verbs or particles .
The following prefixes occur : hang , signifying motion upwards , or towards ; lo , signifying motion towards ; and va , signifying motion on level ground .
Causatives are formed by suffixing tir ; thus , hang-bun-tir-roh , cause him to put on .
Desideratives are formed by suffixing nuam ; thus , a loi-nuam-noh-a , he to enter-wished-not .
Other words suffixed in order to form compound verbs are , nok or na^k , again ; shen , to be able to finish ; ta^m , to be about ; tan , to begin ; vong , all ; zing , always ; zo , completely , etc.
The Negative particle is na^ , noh ; thus , ni-sha^t-na^-tak-in , days-long-not-many-in ; an pe-noh-a , they gave not .
Compare the negative particle nō in Rāngkhōl , Langrong , etc.
In one place the negative lo , common in Lushēi , is used ; thus , bak-shen-lo-v-a , to-cat-finish-able-being-not .
This language passes under various names .
‘ Chitrār , or Qa sh qār as it is called by the Paṭhāns , is bounded on the norṭh by the Hindū Kush range , separating it from Bada khsh ān and Wa kh ān ; on the south by the Indus , Swāt , and Panjkōrā Kōhistāns , and the Asmar district : on the east by Kanjut , Gilgit , Punial , and Dir ; and on the west by the Hindū Kush and Kāfiristāṇ ’ Khō-wār is the language generally spoken throughout Chitrāl , as far down as Drōsh .
In some parts such as Yāsīn , Lutkoh , Madagla sh t and Narsāt , the people have dialects of their own , but they all know Khō-wāṛ According to tradition the whole Chitral Valley was once occupied by Kāfirs , and some Kāfir tribes , e.g.
This tradition is borne out by the fact that the Kāfir languages are much more nearly related to those of the Dard Group than either of these groups is to Khō-wāṛ The last , though undoubtedly a Dardic language , differs from the other two in some essential particulars , such , even , as the forms of the personal pronouns , in which it agrees rather with the Gh alchah languages to the north .
In order to exemplify this , I here give a table showing a number of words in Khō-wār with the corresponding words in two Kāfir and two Dard languages .
It must not be assumed that Khō-wār is so different from the other Piśācha languages as the foregoing table seems to show .

The following sketch of Khō-wār grammar is based on Captain O ’ Brien ’ s work and has been revised on the spot by Khan Sahib Abdul Hakim Khan , to whom I am indebted for many improvements and corrections .
( a ) Vowels .
a , ā , i , ī , u , ū , ē , ai , ō , au , as in Indian languages .
An acute accent marks the accented syllable .
( b ) Consonants .
The letter # has a lingual sound , between l and r .The letter ng is pronounced like the English ng in ‘ sing ’ .
Ph is pronounced p-h , not f.The letters ts and da represent the well-known sounds of Paṣh.tōand Kāshmīrī .
NOUNS .
The Plural is formed by a#ding a , ān , or ĕn .
There are two Declensions : ( a ) Animate , ( b ) Inanimate .
In the First Declension , the word for ‘ from ’ is sar , and for ‘ on ’ is sōra , both added to the Genitive .
In the Second Declension the word for ‘ from ’ is ār , added to the Nominative , and for ‘ on ’ is ṭĕka , added to the Genitive .
The word for ‘ with ’ is sum , added to the Genitive in both declensions .
The interrogative is formed by adding a , or lengthening a final a to ā .
Adjectives precede the noun they govern , and remain unchanged for gender or number .
PRONOUNS : ( a ) Personal These are all declined quite regularly like nouns .
In the Ablative case of the pronouns of the third person , the appropriate post-pŏsitions must be used , according as the pronoun represents an animate or an inanimate object .
When hĕs is a pronominal adjective , then hē may be used for the Nominative or Accusative Singular only .
Similarly , when hăsa is used as an adjective , its Accusative Singular only may be hătĕ .

The language of the two following Specimens , for which I am indebted to Colonel B .E.M .Gurdon , C.I.E., ḌS.O., Assistant British Agent , Chitral , closely agrees with that given in the preceding grammatical sketch , but , Khō-wār being an unwritten language , there are some minor differences which may be noted .
There is a tendency to shorten the o of the oblique case singular so that it is sometimes reduced to u , as in pulungu sh t-u ( acc .
In the pronouns we have haya for haiya , this .
In the verbs there is a tendency to contraction .
In the Present , Future and Present Definite , we have kōsi for korosi , we shall do .
In the Past Tense , the s of the typical st is sometimes dropped .
In the Imperative mood , note dyōr , give ye .
Most Savars have now become Hinduised , and speak Aryan forms of speech , generally Oṛiyā .
Mr.Driver remarks : ‘ The purest representatives of the race call themselves Sobors , and speak a dialect of the Kolarian language which could be understood in Chutiyă Năgpuṛ These people are only to be found in the most jungly parts of the Native States of Orissa and Sambalpur , and a few are also found in Gangpur ’ .
The so-called Sobors alluded to by Mr.Driver have not been returned as speaking a separate language at the last Census , and local information collected for the purposes of this Survey does not make any mention of the Savara dialect in those districts which are said to be the home of the Sobors .
The Sobors of Sambalpur probably speak Khaṛiā , and those of the Orissa Tributary States some form of Kherwārī .
That latter form of speech is almost exclusively spoken in the hilly tracts of Ganjam and Vizagapatam .
It is the prevailing language in the Ichchhapuram , Parlakimedi , and Sompeta taluks of the Ganjam Agency and , together with Telugu , in the Gunapur taluk of the Vizagapatam Agency .
Elsewhere it is spoken side by side with other languages in the hills .

GrammaṛSavara has been largely influenced by Telugu and is no longer an unmixed form of speech .
It is most closely related to Khaṛiā and Juāṅg , but in some characteristics differs from them and agrees with the various dialects of the language which has in this Survey been described under the denomination of Kherwārī .
The notes on Savara grammar which follow are based on the materials printed below .
In those cases in which an h in Kherwārī corresponds to a k in other Muṇḍā dialects , Savara perhaps agrees with the latter .
In ōn , Santālī hân , child , on the other hand , the initial k , h is an old prefix and does not belong to the base .
Nouns .
The dual has been replaced by the plural , which is formed by adding the suffix ji , corresponding to Khaṛiā and Juāng ki .
An is perhaps by origin a demonstrative pronoun , and forms such as wāṅ-an can then be compared with Dravidian forms such as Tamil tagappa-ṉ , father .
The cases of the direct and indirect object are not expressed in the verb .
They are formed by adding suffixes such as an , in , to ; ba , to , and so forth .
The suffix ku in kiñchor-ku , ( he saw ) a dog , and so forth , is Telugu or Oṛiyā .
An is also the suffix of the locative ; thus , siṅ-an and siṅ-leṅ-an , in the house .
An ablative is formed by adding suffixes such as te , sitle , and so on .
The suffix of the genitive is a or na ; thus , wāṅ-an-a , of a father ; gorgāṅ-na , of the village .
Numerals .
The numerals are given in the list of words .
It will be seen that they agree most nearly with those in use in Khaṛiā .
Pronouns .
The following are the personal pronouns : The specimens received from Ramagiri give nēn , I .
N~ēn , my , and nam , thy , are used as pronominal suffixes of the genitive .
An a is often prefixed to nouns , and it can then be translated as a kind of definite article .
It is probably a demonstrative pronoun ; compare Telugu a .
Other demonstrative pronouns are kani and kana , this ; kuni and kuna , that .
The forms ending in i were perhaps originally used to denote animate beings , and those ending in a to denote inanimate nouns .
Interrogative pronouns are bōte , who ?
Verbs .
The Savara verb is characterized by the same simplicity that we observe in the case of Khaṛiā .
The direct and indirect objects are not expressed in the verb ; there is no trace of the many conjugational and inflexional bases of the Kherwārī verb and so forth .
The person of the verb is occasionally expressed by adding personal suffixes .
The most common one is i , or , occasionally , iṅ , for the first person .
In the second person we occasionally find forms such as ḍakol-am , thou wast , and in the third person plural ji is quite common ; thus , eḍikāle ḍako-ji , they were merry .
There are apparently only two tenses , one for the present and future times and one for the past .
The present-future is formed by adding the suffix te .
Te is derived from ten , and the final n is often retained before the suffix of the third person plural .
Before the suffix of the first person the e of te is dropped or replaced by a , or else tenā is used instead .
Tenā is probably the old suffix ten , corresponding to Muṇḍārī tan , and an ā which is perhaps identical with the categorical a of Kherwārī .
The corresponding suffix of the past is le .
The final be has probably nothing to do with the suffix of the past .
It is perhaps a pronominal suffix ; compare Kherwārī bū , we .
In the third person singular ēte is commonly used instead of le ; thus , tiy-ēte , he gave ; jum-ēte , he ate ; gam-ēte , he said , etc.
The most common suffixes of the imperative are ā , ai , ba , and na ; thus , irā , go ; jum-ā , eat ; pāṅ-ai , and pāṅ-ai-ba , bring ; geṇḍa-ba and geṇḍā-nā , draw water , and so on .
A prefix a is often used .
The base alone is used as a verbal noun ; thus , a-jum-bēn , feeding for , in order to feed ; ḍako-ban , being-in , to he .
Relative participles are formed by adding a to the bases of the present and past tenses .
Compare genitive and the relative participles in Telugu .
Other participles are formed by adding an or n ; thus , ḍako-n , being ; tid-ān , striking .
An infix an is sometimes used in a similar way .
The usual conjunctive participle is formed by adding the past base to the participle ending in an ; thus , iyān-ille , having gone ; guān-gū-le , having called .
The negative particle is apparently a prefixed a .
Gam-goṅ-iṅ , I say not , probably contains some negative verb meaning ‘ to be unworthy , ’ ‘ to decline , ’ or something of the kind .
Name of dialecṭThis dialect is commonly known by the first of the three names given above , Chhattīsgaṛhī , or the language of Chhattisgarh .
Chhattīsgaṛhī is also spoken in a part of the latter district , and is there known as Khalṭāhī , or the language of Khalōṭī .
Here , and in the western portion of the Sambalpur district , the language is spoken in its purity .
In the south-west , however , of Raipur , the local language is a form of Oṛiyā .
In the first three the Aryan language is a sub-dialect of Chhattīsgaṛhī , called Surgujiā , which is also spoken in the western portion of the last .
Number of SpeakerṣThe following table shows the estimated number of speakers of Chhattīsgaṛhī : Besides the above Chhattīsgaṛhī is also spoken in the neighbouring Oṛiyā-speaking States and in Bastar State , in which the main Aryan language is the Halabī dialect of Marāṭhī , by settlers from the Chhattīsgaṛhī , or as it is here called the Lariā , country .
Finally , the following are the figures for the Surgujiā sub-dialect : Besides the above , six broken dialects , as named below , are spoken in Chhattisgarh and the neighbouring Feudatory States by aborigines who have forsaken their ancestral tongues , and try to speak the language of their Aryan-speaking neighbours .
These are rather jargons than dialects , and it will be understood that the correctness of the Chhattīsgaṛhī depends a great deal upon the personal equation of each speaker .
The following are these broken dialects : With reference to the above , it is necessary to explain that the term ‘ Sadrī ’ is used in this part of India to imply the form which an Aryan language takes in the mouth of an aborigine .
Thus , Sadrī Korwā means the form which the local Aryan language , in this case Surgujiā , takes in the mouth of a Korwā .
Similarly , the Sadrī Kōl of Bamra means the form which an Aryan language , in this case the Kuṛmālī sub-dialect of Magahī , takes in the mouth of a Kōḷ Two dialects have been inserted in the above list which have not hitherto been classed as Chhattīsgaṛhī , viż , Kalaṅgā and Bhuliā .
They have hitherto been classed as dialects of Oṛiyā .
Kalaṅgā and Bhuliā , when written , are written in the Oṛiya character .
Four dialects , which were originally classed as forms of Chhattīsgaṛhī , have been removed from the list .
They are Halabī , Bastarī , Bhunjiā , and Sadrī Kōḷ An examination of the specimens of Halabī shows that it is , rather , a mixture of Chhattīsgaṛhī , Oṛiyā , and Marāṭhī , and can most conveniently be considered in connexion with the last-named language .
It is identical with the Kuṛmālī sub-dialect of Magahī spoken in the Manbhum District .
GrammaṛThe usual phonetic rules of Eastern Hindī regarding the shortening of the antepenultimate vowel apply to Chhattīsgaṛhī , and need not be repeated here .
The forms that strike a stranger , who is familiar only with the pure Eastern Hindī of Oudh , are , the sign of the Dative-Accusative which is often lā even in the Accusative , and the plural termination man .
It is believed that the following sketch of Chhattīsgaṛhī grammar will be found to contain all that is necessary for the understanding of the specimens given on the subsequent pages .

Name of the Language.Theword juāṅg means ‘ man ’ in the dialect , and the denomination Juāṅg as the name of a language is accordingly of the same kind as Hō , Kūrkū and so on .
The Juāṅg territory forms an islet within the Oṛiyā area , and that latter language has largely influenced Juāṅg and will probably in the course of time supersede it .
Number of speakerṣThe number of speakers was estimated for the purposes of this Survey as follows .

Campbell , Sir George , Specimens of Languages of India .
It has abandoned the most prominent Muṇḍā characteristics , and its inflexional system is more closely in accordance with Aryan principles than is the case with the Muṇḍā languages proper .
I cannot find any indication of the existence of semi-consonants .
Nouns .
There are several suffixes in use after nouns the meaning of which I cannot ascertain .
A suffix ra or r occurs in words such as iti and iti-ra , hand ; jotā-ra , shoes ; dipe-ra , lamp ; buyi-ra , mother ; kathā-ra and kathā-r , tale .
A suffix ṅge is used in words such as koni-ṅge , son ; kunu-niṅge , son ; bui-ṅge , mother .
It is possible , that this suffix is originally the suffixed pronoun of the first person .
It is however used in a general way without reference to the first person , and it can also be compared with the Kui suffix añju .
A suffix ḍe is used in a similar way in words such as iti-ḍe , the belly ; ijiṅ-ḍā-te , on his feet .
It seems to be connected with Santālī ṭak ’ , or else to be the pronominal suffix of the third person .
The suffix ḍe is often added to a suffix m .Thus , boko-m-ḍe , thy elder brother ; buin-ma-ḍā , of the mother ; koni-m-ḍe , the son ; kona-ma-ḍā ; of the son ; dhan-um-ḍe , the property .
The suffix m is used alone in words such as boba-m-te , to the father .
It should probably be compared with the pronominal suffix m of the second person in connected forms of speech .
All such suffixes are used in an arbitrary way , and if the explanation given above is correct , their original meaning has been forgotten .
The suffix of the plural is ki as in Khaṛiā .
Compare the suffix ra or r mentioned above .
The usual case suffixes are , dative , te ; thus , boba-m-te , to the father : ablative , ta , tai ; thus , bobam-ki-ta , from fathers ; ne-tai , from here : genitive , ā , ra , r ; thus , bābā-y-ā , of the father ; bobam-ḍā , of thy father ; dhani-ra , of the rich man ; bobār-ki-r , of fathers : locative ra , re ; thus , gāũ-ra , in the village ; kati-re , near .
All these suffixes are well known from connected forms of speech .
The genitive suffix r is probably derived from ra .
The ablative is , as in other connected forms of speech , used to denote the compared noun in comparisons .
Numerals .
The numerals are given in the list of words .
Higher numbers are counted in twenties .
Pronouns .
The following are the personal pronouns : I have not found any traces of the dual pronouns or of the double plural of the first person .
It will be seen that the suffixes ñje , ḍe , and ri correspond to those mentioned above when dealing with nouns .
Pronominal suffixes and infixes do not appear to be used .
M , n , and h are sometimes prefixed to verbal tenses in order to indicate that the subject is of the second person singular , the first person plural , and the second person plural , respectively .
They are probably derived from pronominal suffixes added to the word immediately preceding the verb .
Compare the remarks under the head of Verbs , below .
The interrogative pronouns are aḍi , who ?
Verbs .
The conjugation of verbs is of the same kind as in Khaṛiā .
I cannot find any traces of the categorical a , of the pronominal infixes , or of the rich variety of forms found in other Muṇḍā languages .
The person of the subject is sometimes marked by means of pronominal prefixes .
The same form of the verb is also used in the third person singular and dual .
In the second person singular , on the other hand , an m is sometimes prefixed , and similarly n is prefixed in the first , and h in the second person plural .
These prefixes are probably originally pronominal suffixes added to the word preceding the verb .
So far as I can judge from the scanty materials at my disposal the various tenses are formed as follows .
The future is formed by adding an e as in Khaṛiā ; thus , abhaj-e , I shall strike ; gātā-e , I shall say .
Neuter verbs add nā ; thus , janāmal-nā , it will be known .
The present is formed by adding the suffixes ke and ḍe ; thus , sara-ke , he is grazing ; kaba-ḍe , he is making .
In abha-ke-ki , they strike , the pronominal suffix ki , they , is added .
Ke apparently corresponds to the copula ke in Khaṛiā .
There are various suffixes denoting past time .
In the first place the suffixes e and nā , which usually denote the future , are occasionally used to denote the past ; thus , kib-e , thou madest ; toṅga-nā , she stood ; ḍe-nā , he came .
They are probably not properly past tenses , but denote the indefinite time .
The most usual suffix is o or a , to which a y is prefixed after vowels .
A suffix corresponding to Khaṛiā si occurs in the forms sor , cher , and cheḍe .
The suffix se-ke , corresponding to Khaṛiā si-ki , is used to denote the ordinary past .
Other forms of the past tense are nech-eḍ-ā , he returned ; leb-er-a , he slept ; pāñcher-a , he devised ; and so forth .
They apparently contain a suffix corresponding to Santālī et ’ .
Buḍiyate , came to a close , is formed by adding ate .
Compare the suffix atā in Bīrhā^ṛ .
The imperative seems to be formed as in Khaṛiā .
A suffix de is used in forms such as hana-de , go ; āsue-de , put on .
Nikimā , let us make , seems to contain an imperative particle corresponding to Santālī ma .
Verbal nouns are biśuā , to fill ; gogaḍate , to take off ; sarāyeḍaya , in order to feed ; nabuṅre , in order to feast .
Sarāyeḍ-aya is perhaps the past tense of a causative verb .
A very common participle is formed by adding the suffix ja ; thus , jimuja , eating ; suṅgiyāja , smelling ; anoja , going ; ḍeñja , coming ; toṅganañja , arising .
Another suffix of that participle is apparently me ; thus , bājime , eating ; esidame , having been .
Ḍē~-ḍē~ , coming , is the doubled base used as an adverbial participle , as is also the case in Khaṛiā .
The negative particles are a prefixed mā and a suffixed je-nā ; thus , mā ano , he did not go ; bhāṅge-je-nā , I did not break .
The base of the verb substantive is āsi ; thus , āsi-ke , am ; āsi-ana , was ; compare Oṛiyā āchhi .
The verb jim , to eat , is used as an auxiliary verb in order to form a passive .
As its name implies , Baghēlī is the language of the Baghēls , that is to say , the dialect spoken in Baghelkhand , a tract which corresponds very nearly to the area covered by the present Baghelkhand Agency .
So , also , in the British Districts of Fatehpur , Banda , and Hamirpur a form of Baghēlī is spoken which is more or less mixed with the latter language .
The district of Banda is a portion of Bundelkhand , and the language spoken in it has hitherto always been called Bundēlī .
The resemblance between the language of Banda and Baghēlī had , however , been recognised , and it has been long erroneously accepted that , therefore , Bundēlī and Baghēlī were different names of the same language .
The two languages are now shown by this Survey to be radically distinct , and the true explanation is that although the district of Banda is in Bundelkhand , the language spoken within its borders is not Bundēlī but Baghēlī .
Language boundarieṣOn the north Baghēlī is bounded by the impure Awadhī of South-East Allahabad and by the Western Bhojpurī spoken in Central Mirzapur .
On the south it meets the mixture of languages and dialects , of which Marāṭhī is the principal , spoken in Balaghat , and , on the west and south-west , it is bounded by Bundēlī .
Here the language , while based on Baghēlī , is more and more mixed with Bundēlī as we go westwards , till , in the District of Jalaun , we find a mixed dialect called Nibaṭṭhā , in which the Bundēlī predominates , and , we may say , that we have a form of Bundēlī mixed with Baghēlī .
On the contrary , they are peculiar to certain tribes who speak them , while the language of the bulk of the population of the locality in which these tribes live is something altogether different .
The following table shows the number of speakers of these broken dialects of the south and where each is spoken : For reasons the same as those given in the case of Awadhī , it is impossible to estimate the number of speakers of Baghēlī elsewhere , outside the area in which the dialect is a vernacular .
The only work which deals in any way with Baghēlī is Dr.Kellogg ’ s Grammar mentioned below .
The Holy Bible , containing the Old and New Testaments translated from the Original into the Bhugelkhunda Language .
S.H ., ḌḌ , LL.Ḍ, A Grammar of the Hindĭ Language: .
Written character .
As in the case of Awadhī both the Dēva-nāgarī and the Kaithī characters are used in writing Baghēlī .
Baghēlī Grammar .
The only two important points in which Baghēlī differs are that it is fond of adding the enclitic word tē or tai to the past tenses of verbs , and that it has abandoned the letter b , which is typical of the first and second persons of the future tense in Awadhī , and taken h instead .
The various forms of ‘ Riwăĭ ’ Grammar are given by Dr.Kellogg .
They are reproduced in the skeleton grammar following .
The forms must have been obtained from the north of Rewa , near the Allahabad border , where , as previously pointed out , see page 1 , the language , though called Baghēlī , is really Awadhī .
Hence , in this skeleton grammar , one typical sign of Baghēlī is wanting .
This is not a mere variety of spelling .
So far as I can gather from the specimens , the past tenses of transitive verbs are construed actively .
That is to say the subject , in such circumstances , is put in the Nominative , and not the Agent , case .
The usual rule of the shortening of the antepenultimate vowel obtains in Baghēlī .

Two specimens and a list of Standard Words and Phrases have been received from Darjeeling .
The vowels a , i , and u may be either long or short .
in the plural suffix chī or chi .
It is therefore possible that Yākhā agrees with Tibetan in not possessing really long vowels .
The dialect also possesses corresponding sets of palatals , dentals , and labials , and probably also of cerebrals .
Ch interchanges with j and z in the plural suffix chī , ji or zi .
Concurrent consonants are sometimes assimilated ; thus , kām-me instead of kām-be , on work ; hip-pāng and hichchi , two ; ten , village , but tem-be , in the viliage ; ung-khi , 
We have no information about the use of tones and accent .
The visarga which occurs in words such as nuh.-nā, small , probably denotes the abrupt tone .
Prefixes .
The prefixes ā , i , and u are of common occurrence ; thus , ā-gā ā-pā , my father ; i-chchyā and u-chchyā , his son .
Ā is originally the possessive pronoun of the first person , and i and u the corresponding forms of the third person .
A similar use of prefixed personal pronouns is common in connected languages .
Article .
There are no articles .
The numeral ikko , one , is , however , often used with the meaning of an indefinite article ; thus , ikko yāp-mī , a man .
Nouns .
Gender .
The natural gender is distinguished by using different words or by adding qualifying affixes .
Number .
There are two numbers , the singular and the plural .
The usual suffix of the plural is chi or zi ; thus , bā-chi , fathers ; on-zi , horses .
Case .
There are no separate suffixes to indicate the subject of intransitive verbs or the object .
In kā-ngā uchchyā-go mok-tu-ngā , I have beaten his son , we apparently have a dative-accusative formed by adding go .
The subject of transitive verbs is put in the case of the agent , which is formed by adding the suffix ngā .
The same suffix is also used to denote the instrument ; thus , sāk-ngā , from hunger .
The suffix ngā is closely related to the suffix gā , which is used to form genitives ; thus , bā-gā , of a father .
In such forms the initial consonant of the genitive suffix has perhaps coalesced with a preceding ng ; compare āning , we .
The governed noun is sometimes repeated before the governing noun by means of a pronominal prefix ; thus , om-bā-gā u-bāng-be , your-father ’ s his-house-in , in your father ’ s house .
There is no proper suffix of the dative ; compare kā piyāng , me ( - to ) give .
Hodgson mentions a suffix ā .
It does not occur in the specimens , but is perhaps contained in the example ikko metnyung-mā ā-chiyā , to a daughter , in the list , though the initial ā in ā-chiyā can also be the pronominal prefix .
The locative-terminative is formed by adding be to the base or to the genitive ; thus , rājī-be , in a country ; tem-be , to the village .
Adjectives .
Adjectives precede the words they qualify .
I do not know if it is more than a mere chance that the suffix hā in the list is used before plural nouns , while nā is used in the singular .
Compare the plural suffix hā in Limbu .
The particle of comparison is apparently the Aryan bhandā ; thus , nā-bhandā-cha ket-nā , anyone-from high , highest ; kāk bhandā nu-nā , all from good , best .
Numerals .
The first numerals are given in the list of words .
The suffix chi , ji , which is added to most numerals , is perhaps identical with the plural suffix chi .
In hip-pāng nu-hā yāp-mi-chi , two good men , we apparently have a generic particle pāng .
Higher numbers appear to be counted in twenties ; compare hi-bong hichchi nga i-bong , twenties two and ten , fifty .
Pronouns It has already been remarked that short forms of the personal pronouns are used as prefixes with the meaning of possessive pronouns .
The prefixed pronouns are the shortest forms of the full bases .
Compare ā-ning and kā-ni , we ; ā-gā , my ; ā , prefix of the first person .
The most common forms of the personal pronouns will be found in the table which follows .
The suffix khi or khik in ing-khi , thou ; i-khi , he , etc., is probably a demonstrative pronoun .
It is sometimes also added to the pronoun of the first person ; thus , ā-ning-khi , we .
The suffixes of the plural are ni or ning , and ji or jing , and zi .
The latter suffix is the same as that used with nouns .
Other pronouns of the third person are hitnā , he ; hunnā , he ; and according to Hodgson , khenā , yonā , monā , and tonā , he .
They can all be used as demonstrative pronouns .
Other demonstratives are nā , this ; ni , this ; go , that ; u , that ; inu , that ; i-khā , those , etc.
Interrogative pronouns are i-sā , who ?
Indefinite pronouns are effected by adding chā to interrogatives ; thus , i-sā-ngā-cha , by anyone ; i-je-ti-chā , anything ; hene-chā , anywhere ; kaile-chā , ever .
The interrogative pronouns are also used as relatives ; thus , wākkhu-wā-be isā-ngā u-khī pāk-su-nā , with a citizen who sent him ; jetikā ā-gā waitnā kāk ung-khi-gā , what mine is , all thine , all that is mine is thine .
Such phrases are due to the influence of Aryan vernaculars .
Verbs .
The verb is in all essential features a noun .
The subject of transitive verbs is put in the case of the agent , which looks like a modified form of the genitive .
The person of the subject is not regularly distinguished in the verb .
There are only some indications of a tendency to add affixes denoting the subject .
Thus , a ng or ngā is sometimes added in the first , and a ka or ga in the second person .
These affixes are inserted before the copula ; thus , khem-me-ngā-nā , going-in-I-am , I shall go ; khem-me-ka-nā , going-in-thou-art , thou wilt go .
This state of affairs agrees with the practice in Muṇḍā languages .
The verb is also shown to be a noun by the fact that plural suffixes can be added .
Verb substantive .
Several bases are used as a verb substantive .
The base ho in mā-ho , is it not ?
The materials available are not sufficient for giving a full sketch of the conjugation of the verb substantive , the more so because the bad handwriting of the list has made it impossible to arrive at certainty about the real form in all cases .
Finite verb .
The conjugation of finite verbs is apparently comparatively simple .
Present time .
The base alone is sometimes used with the meaning of a present ; thus , kā ī , I am ; kā khek-ngā , I go .
The copula nā , is , is often added ; thus , wait-nā , is ; wai-ka-nā , art.
Other forms of the present are apparently participles .
Another suffix of a similar participle is hā ; compare the suffix hā used with adjectives .
The suffix me is perhaps connected with the locative suffix be .
The suffix tu is mok-tu , ( he ) beats , ( you ) beat ; mok-tu-gā , beatest , perhaps denotes an object of the third person .
It has an m added in forms such as mok-tum , we beat ; tok-tum-nā , he is found ; compare the suffix m which is used in several plural forms of the verb in Limbu .
Past time .
Several of the forms mentioned above are also used with the meaning of a past .
The base alone is apparently used in forms such as chugu-ngā , I did .
copula nā is commonly added ; thus , lu-nā , he said ; lāmā-ng-nā , I have walked ; khyā-kā-nā , wentest .
The suffixes wā , hā , and tu or du occur in forms such as cho-wā-chi , they ate ; lu-wā-nā , he said ; tāe-wā-nā , has come ; chugu-wā-ng-nā , I have done ; leksā-hā , occurred ; mok-tu-ngā , I have beaten ; sim-du-nā , he asked .
A suffix sā , se occurs in forms such as wai-sā and wai-sā-nā , was ; lek-sā-nā , lek-se-nā , and lek-seyā-nā , became .
It also occurs in forms such as lek-sā , be , and is perhaps the suffix of a past verbal noun or participle .
The suffix sā is perhaps connected with su , which is often used in order to form a past tense ; thus , leptā-hāk-su , he had wasted ; pāk-su-nā , he sent ; si-suk-su-no , killedest ; tok-tu-su-nā , he was found .
Compare the final ū denoting an object of the third person singular in Limbu .
Future .
The participle ending in me is commonly used to form a future ; thus , khem-me-ngā-nā , I shall go ; tā-me-ng-nā , I shall come ; khem-me-ka-nā , thou wilt go .
Such forms do not differ from the present .
The suffix m in chā-m , we will eat ; chugu-m , we will make ( merry ) , is perhaps connected with me .
Forms such as lāsā-khep-mā par-lā , to-return is-required , I will return ; khusi chug-mā-nu wai-nā , merry making-for is , we should make merry ; tār-nā par-chha , coming is required , one should come , are not futures .
Imperative .
The base alone is commonly used as an imperative ; thus , pi , give .
A suffix ā is often added ; thus , yung-ā , sit ; ābā , come ; pugā , stand ; siyā , die .
The final ng is perhaps a pronominal suffix denoting an object of the first person singular .
The suffixes tu , du , and su are used in forms such as mok-tu , beat ; thun-du , bind ; tak-su , draw .
A suffix nu is used in wā-mā-pi-nu , put on ; āp-tā-nu , bring .
The negative imperative is formed by adding n to the base ; thus , khyā-n , do not go ; chugu-n , do not do .
Verbal nouns .
The most usual verbal noun is formed by adding the suffix mā ; thus , wā-mā , to live ; chuk-mā , to do ; chā-mā , food .
Mok-mā-gā , to beat , and mok-mā-ngā , beating , are the genitive and the instrumental , respectively , of this form .
Other verbal nouns are formed by adding ā , nā or tā ; thus , uni-ā , to go ; wet-nā , to be ; mok-tā hesu-ng , to beat can-I , I may beat .
In chārā-chuk-nu , in order to feed , we have the suffix nu which is also used in the imperative .
It has already been mentioned that several participles are apparently used in order to form the finite tenses .
we being-are , we are ; yung-me-nā , being-is , he lives , seem to contain participles , or rather verbal nouns , ending in wā , hā , me , respectively .
Forms such as mok-mā-ngā , beating , have also been mentioned and explained as cases of the verbal noun .
As in other connected forms of speech participles are also formed by adding suffixes to a verbal noun which is identical with the base ; thus , sohung , seeing-from , having seen .
Siyā-rok , dead , seems to mean ‘ dying like ’ and to contain a verbal noun ending in ā .
In siyā-rok-mā , dead , the suffix mā has been added .
It is the same suffix as that used in the formation of verbal nouns .
Mā-sāb-wā-rī , lost , is formed by adding the suffix wā mentioned above and a particle rī , which is perhaps an emphatic suffix .
A suffix nu occurs in we-nu-chā , being ; yem-nu-nā , fatted .
The latter word contains the suffix nā which seems to be the usual suffix of the relative participle .
Compare the suffix nā used with adjectives .
The suffix is hung , which probably means ‘ from ’ .
This ra is probably an intensifying or indefinite particle related to the rī which has been mentioned above .
The most common suffix of the conjunctive participle is , however , nā ; thus , chugunā , having done .
Passive voice .
There is no passive voice .
Negative verb .
The negative verb is apparently formed by suffixing n and adding nā , is ; thus , wāmme-nga-n-nā , I will not remain .
Hodgson states that the negative particle is an infix ni or nin .
If that be the case , the negative verb is formed by adding the negative verb substantive formed by prefixing n to the copula nā .
Mā-n-nā , it is not , seems to contain a double negative , the particle mā and n .Interrogative particle .
There is apparently an interrogative particle lā ; thus , i-lā , what ?
Another particle i is used in disjunctive questions ; thus , cho-ko-nā-i mān-nā-i , have you eaten or not ?
The usual order of words is subject , object , verb .
A list of Standard Words and Phrases will be found on pp .
It will be remembered that one of the typical peculiarities of Bāgṛī is that the initial k of the genitive postposition is changed to g , so that kō becomes gō .
The dative postposition kū~ becomes gū~ ; the ablative postposition tī becomes dī ; the past tense of the verb substantive tō , was , becomes dō , and similarly the illative conjunction tō , then , becomes dō .
The declension of nouns follows the usual north-western Rājasthānī forms .
The nominative of strong masculine a-bases ends in ō , not ā , and its oblique form and plural ends in ā , not ē .
Thus , ghōṛō , a horse , oblique form ghōṛā .
There is the usual locative in ē , as in ghōṛē , on a horse .
The agent case , however , takes the postposition nē , and is regularly employed before the past tenses of transitive verbs .
The usual postpositions are Dative-accusative khȭ , gū~ , gē ( locative of the genitive ) , kō ( borrowed from Hindōstānī ) , nē ( a Gujarātī form ) , nū~ ( Panjābī ) .
Ablative , dī , san , kōlȭ ( from-near ) .
Genitive , gō ( Bāgṛī ) , rō ( Mārwāṛī ) , kā ( Hindōstānī ) .
Locative , mā~ .
Sometimes rē is used as a sign of the agent case as in un-rē dīnō , he gave ; jin-rē , by whom .
The genitive postpositions end in ē , when agreeing with a noun in the locative , as in in-rē wāstē , for this .
In one case we have nē , the locative of the Gujarātī genitive suffix nō , viż , in chillaṛ-nē kaṛē , with the husks .
Rā is used as the sign of the accusative in jē-rā sūr khāvē-dā , what the swine were eating .
The vocative particle is rē when addressing men , and rī , when addressing women .
The oblique plural sometimes ends in an , as in Rājasthānī .
As a general rule Hindōstānī and Panjābī forms are also freely used , so that , though based on Rājasthānī , the language is essentially mixed in character .
The numerals are as in Hindōstānī .
The first two personal pronouns are as follows .
The agent case is the same as the nominative : Maĩ , I , by me ; mhārō , my ; mū-khȭ , to me ; ham , we , by us ; hamārō , our .
In both pronouns Hindōstānī forms are also freely employed .
‘ He , ’ ‘ that ’ is ō or woh , oblique singular ū , nom .
vē or veh ; oblique plural ū~ or un .
The verb substantive is thus declined in the present : The following forms are also used : Note that , as in Northern Gujarātī , the second person singular is the same as the first person singular .
Note , also , that all persons of the plural end in ā~ .
Finally , hai or chhai can be used for any person of the present tense .
This also occurs in Gujarātī dialects .
The past tense is dō , hēgō-dō , or chhēgō-dō .
The masculine plural is dā , hēgā-dā , or chhēgā-dā .
The simple present tense of the finite verb takes the following forms .
 The Present Definite is formed as in Rājasthānī and Gujarātī , by conjugating the verb substantive with the simple present , and not with the present participle .
The Future has s for its characteristic letter as in eastern Rājasthānī and Gujarātī .
There is a future passive participle in bō , which can also be used for the future , as in karᵃbō , it is to be done , i.e., ( we ) shall do .
The Imperative is as usual .
It seems that the syllable gō ( feminine gī ) may be added to all these forms without affecting the sense .
The past participle ends in iō .
From this past tenses are formed exactly as in Hindōstānī .
The Perfect sometimes combines the past participle with the verb substantive into one word .
Karᵃnō , to do , makes its past participle kiō or kīnō .
The present participle is mārᵃtō , striking ; the infinitive , mārᵃnō , to strike ; and the conjunctive participle , mār , mār-gē , or mār-kē , having struck .
In khawāṛiō , caused to feed , we have a causal verb formed by suffixing āṛ , as in Rājasthānī .
I-go , this ; mgū-o , that , are given as demonstrative pronouns .
Interrogative pronouns are sāg and khi-go , who ?
The indefinite particle chhang , also , is added to interrogative bases in order to form indefinite pronouns ; thus , sāg-chhang , anybody ; ti-chhang , anything .
Verbs .
We are very unsatisfactorily informed about the use of pronominal suffixes for indicating the person and number of the subject and object , and about the formation of tenses .
A dual and a plural subject of an imperative is indicated by adding chīe , num ’ - ye , respectively .
The suffix āng is added to denote an object of the first person singular in īy-āng-ye , give me .
The suffix of the imperative is e or ye ; see the examples just given .
The negative particle is perhaps a prefixed mā ; thus , mān , is not , no .
There is said to be a negative suffix - ī- , and the negative imperative is formed by adding man ’ to .
They are found between the Likhu and Arun rivers AUTHORITY Hodgson , B .H ., Comparative Vocabulary of the several Languages ( Dialects ) of the celebrated people called Kirântis , now occupying the Eastern-most province of the kingdom of Nӗp ă l , or the basin of the river Árun , which province is named after them , Kirânt .
Nouns .
The prefix ū , ūm , which occurs in forms such as ū-ngālūng , face ; ūm-pā , father ; ū-mā , mother , etc., is by origin a pronominal prefix of the third person .
Gender is distinguished by using different words or by adding qualifying words ; thus , ūm-pā , father ; ū-mā , mother : sorõ-chhā , man ; mār-chhā , woman : sorõ-chhā chhā , son ; mār-chhā chhā , daughter : pāchhā , old man ; māchhā , old woman : khlī-pā , dog ; khlī-mā , bitch : wāsa ōpā , male bird ; wāsa ōmā , female bird : ūmpā hatti , male elephant ; ūmmā hatti , female elephant : pī ūmpā , bull ; pī ūmmā , cow .
We have no information about the use of suffixes denoting number .
It will be seen in what follows that such suffixes are used with pronouns , and there is no reason for supposing that the same is not the case with nouns .
The various cases are formed by adding suffixes .
Thus we find wā for the agent ; dā for the locative ; dā-no and dā-kā , for the ablative , and so on .
Other locative suffixes are probably lo , la and pa ; thus , khong-lo , then ; dha-lo and dha-la , above ; wos-pa , now ; tes-pa , then , etc.
The suffix of the genitive is said to be mi or mo ’ .
The genitive suffix can be dropped , and the governed word can be indicated by means of a pronominal prefix before the governed one ; thus , pī ūm-chhā , cow its-young , a calf .
Adjectives often end in ko ; thus , kūre-ko , hot ; īse and īse-ko , bad .
This ko is probably a demonstrative pronoun which adds definiteness , so that īse-ko should properly be translated ‘ the bad one ’ .
The first numerals will be found in the table on p .343 .
Pronouns .
The following are the personal pronouns : There are no certain traces of a separate dual in the materials .
The final ī is probably a plural suffix ; compare khū-ī , they .
The suffix chu in khū-chu , they , is another plural sullix , or else it is a dual termination .
The final ni in kha-ī-ni , you , is perhaps also a plural suffix ; compare Limbu khe-nī , Rāi ān-ni , you , and so on .
The pronoun khānā , thou , is identical with hānā and ānā in other Khambu dialects .
Other pronouns are nyao , this ; hyāo-ko and hyā-ko , this one ; tyā , that , tyā-ko , that one ; sō , which ?
Verbs .
We have no information about the use of pronominal suffixes to distinguish the person of the subject .
The suffix ng is used to denote an object of the first person in īdo-ng , give me ; compare īdu , give .
The usual suffix of the imperative is ō or u ; thus , chō , eat ; dūngu , drink .
Other imperatives end in ā ; thus , riyā , laugh ; khāpā , weep ; bānā , come ; wōnā , run .
The final na in im ’ - sa-na , sleep , is perhaps a suffix of the second person plural , while im ’ - sa , sleep , seems to be the ordinary singular ; compare Rūngchhēnbūng im ’ - sa , sleep thou ; imsa-chi , sleep ye two ; imsa-nin , sleep ye .
The negative particle is said to be a suffixed or infixed ī .
A prefix ma apparently occurs in ma-dang , without , lit .
The negative with imperatives is mi , mai , or dā .
Nouns .
The natural gender is distinguished in the usual way by means of separate terms or by adding qualifying words .
We have no information about the formation of the dual and plural .
The genitive is formed by prefixing the governed to the governing word , the former being often at the same time repeated by means of a demonstrative pronoun prefixed to the latter ; thus , tāa sām , head ’ s hair , the hair of the head ; pī-mi ūm-chhā , cow its young , calf .
Other relations are indicated by adding postpositions , such as ā , by ; ām , from ; pi , in ; ngāng and māng , with ; māngdi , without .
The first five numerals are given in the table on p .343 .
Pronouns .
The following are the personal pronouns : 
Name of dialecṭOrigiṇThe Musalmān armies imposed their language on their co-religionists in the Deccan from the first .
At the present day , whether the language of the country is Marāṭhī , Tamil , Telugu , or some other Dravidian form of speech , the Musalmāns of southern India all employ that form of Hindōstānī , commonly known as Dakhinī , the language of the Deccan , or as Musalmānī , the language of Musalmānṣ It was in the Deccan that Hindōstānī , under the form of Urdū , first received cultivation , and it was at the hands of Walī of Aurangabad ( cir .
1700 ) , the ‘ Father of Rē kh ta , ’ that a standard of literary form was given to it .
Without , however , going so far as that , it is not correct to look upon Dakhinī as a corrupt form of speech .
Such are , for instance , the employment of the oblique genitive as a base for declension in phrases like mērē-kū , to me , where the standard would have mujh-kō .
Again , the oblique plural in ā~ survives to the present day in the Vernacular Hindōstānī and in Dakhinī , but is excluded from Urdū prose .
So also the nasalization of the infinitive , as in mārnā~ , to strike , is only a survival of the old neuter gender , which has disappeared in the modern literary languages , but is still common in the dialects .
Only in one respect can Dakhinī be called a corrupt language .
In Madras and the south of the Bombay Presidency , no doubt under the influence of the surrounding Dravidian languages , the passive construction of the past tense of transitive verbs has been abandoned .
Transitive and intransitive verbs are now treated in exactly the same way , and though the subject is occasionally put into the agent case with nē , the nē is altogether neglected as a factor in the idiom , and the verb agrees in number and gender with the subject ( although in the agent case ) , and not with the object .
In Central Bombay , on the other hand , the presence of Marāṭhī has prevented the proper employment of the agent case from disappearing .
Locality where spokeṇWe may roughly take the Satpura Hills , south of the Narbadā valley , as the boundary between Dakhinī Hindōstānī , as a recognised literary form of speech , and the standard Hindōstānī of Delhi and Lucknow .
I here give a brief account of the main points in which the dialect differs from standard Hindōstānī .
DECLENSION .
Nouns .
The oblique form singular is formed as in standard Urdū .
The nominative and oblique plural are often formed differently .
The common rule is that the nominative plural usually ends in ē or ā~ , and the oblique plural in ȭ or yaũ .
Sometimes ȭ is used for the nominative plural , and ā~ for the oblique plural .
Agent ......nē , nī .
Dative-Accusative ....kū , kū~ , kō , kē-taĩ , kataĩ , kanē , to or for .
Ablative ......sū , sū~ , sō , sȭ , sē , sē~ , satī , from , by .
Genitive ......kā , ( kē , kī ) ( as in the Standard ) .
Locative ......mē~ , mȭ , in ; pō , pa , par , on .
Pronouns .
The following are the first two personal pronouns : The forms which differ from the standard should not be considered corruptions .
They all occur in various dialects of Western Hindī and were brought down to the Deccan before Urdū was standardised .
Special attention may be drawn to the employment of the oblique form of the genitive as a general oblique base .
Although this is almost totally excluded from standard Urdū , it is common in all the vernacular dialects of northern Hindostan .
The forms hamnā and tumnā are oblique forms of haman and ṭuman , respectively , and point to Rājasthānī influence .
The Demonstrative Pronouns , including the Pronoun of the third person , are , DAKHINĪ HINDŌSTĀNĪ OR MUSALMĀNĪ.PageNo-61The singular is often used for the plural , and vice versa .
The Agent Singular is often inē or inī , and unē or unī .
The Reflexive Pronoun is , Singular and Plural .
The Relative , Correlative , and Interrogative Pronouns are , The Hindōstānī Dative-Accusatives jisē , plur .
The Neuter Interrogative Pronoun is kyā or kā , what ?, oblique form kāhē , kāhī , or kī .
The Indefinite Pronouns are kōī , obl .
CONJUGATION .
The Infinitive usually ends in nā , as in Standard Hindōstānī .
The Present Participle ends in tā , or , sometimes , in at or t , as in mārtā or mārat , striking ; dēt , giving .
The feminine plural ends in tiyā~ or tyā~ .
The Past Participle ends in ā , or sometimes in yā .
The feminine plural ends in yā~ .
The irregular forms are as in Standard Hindōstānī .
This participle is sometimes used with the genitive of the subject , as in woh mērā mārā hai , he is killed of me , i.e.
Other forms of the postposition , attached to either mār or mārē , are kē , kar , kar-kē , kar-kō , kar-kar , kȭ , ka .
Examples of other verbs are hō-kō or hōē-kō , having been ; ā-kar or āē-kar , having come .
The Verb Substantive is thus conjugated , Present , I am .
The plural is often used for the singular .
The Past Tense is thā , etc., as in the Standard .
The conjugation of the Active Verb closely agrees with that of Standard Hindōstānī .
In Madras the second person plural is the same as the first and third persons , as in tum mārē~ , you may strike .
In Bombay it ends in ō as in the Standard .
The present subjunctive ( old present ) is often employed as a present or even as a future .
The singular is commonly used instead of the plural .
The second plural imperative ends in ō , ȭ or au , as mārō , mārȭ or mārau , strike ye .
The future is , as usual , formed by adding gā ( masc .
gyā~ ) to the present subjunctive or old present ; thus , maĩ mārū~-gā , I shall strike .
The singular is commonly used for the plural , as ham mārēgā or mārē~gē , we shall strike .
The con jugation of the past tense of intransitive verbs is as the standard .
In the case of transitive verbs custom differs .
In Bombay , the standard idiom is followed , as in maĩ-nē mārā , I struck ; maĩ-nē yeh bāt sunī , I heard this affair .
In Madras , on the contrary , nē is usually omitted , and the verb is treated as if it were intransitive agreeing with the subject in gender and number .
Sometimes nē is used , but here it is pleonastic , and the construction is the same as when it is not used , the verb still agreeing in gender and number with the subject , and not with the object .
The same idioms are employed , according to locality , for all the past tenses of transitive verbs .
In Bombay , the passive construction is employed , while in Madras it is not .
It is often employed with intransitive verbs , e.g.
, us-nē chalā , he went ; and even with the present tense of transitive verbs as in maĩ-nē mārtā-hū~ , I am striking .
Throughout its history , the city also gave its name to its dependencies and to the surrounding district , and Kanaujī therefore means , literally , the dialect of the old kingdom of Kanauj .
It is also found in Cawnpore and Hardoi , but in the latter district it is more or less mixed ( according to locality ) with the Awadhī dialect of Eastern Hindī spoken to its east , and in the former it shows signs of the influence not only of Awadhī , but of Bundēlī .
Language BoundarieṣKanaujī is bounded on the west and north-west by Braj Bhākhā and on the south by Bundēlī .
Both of these are , like Kanaujī , dialects of Western Hindī .
On its east and north-east it has the Awadhī dialect of Eastern Hindī .
VarietieṣThe area over which Kanaujī is spoken is not a large one , and near the borders it is influenced by neighbouring dialects .
The only important one is that , north of the Ganges and in Cawnpore , there is a tendency to add a short i to a word ending in a consonant .
I have already said that in Cawnpore and Hardoi the dialect is mixed .
This is specially the case in Eastern Hardoi ( in the Tah.ṣīlof Sandila ) , where it is difficult to say whether the language is Awadhī or Kanaujī .
The same is the case in Cawnpore , and in that district , in the tract on the bank of the Jamna opposite the district of Hamirpur , the language is so influenced by the Bundēlī of the latter district that it has a special name of its own , Tirhārī , or the language of the river bank .
Literature.Asa literary language Kanaujī has been overshadowed by its more powerful neighbour Braj Bhākhā .
AuthoritieṣThe only work dealing with Kanaujī which I have seen is Mr.Kellogg ’ s Hindī grammar .
The dialect employed differs considerably from that illustrated in the following pages .
It prefers the termination ō to the au of that dialect .
Both dialects are fond of adding u to the end of nouns which in ordinary Hindōstānī terminate in a consonant .
With reference to the accompanying skeleton grammar of Kanaujī the following additional facts may be noted : As in other dialects there is a tendency to drop h between two vowels .
Strong masculine tadbhava adjectives ( including the genitive case and participles ) , which in Standard Hindī end in ā , in Kanaujī end in ō .
Strong masculine substantives , however , end in ā , and this ā is in some cases ( mostly nouns of relationship ) not changed to ē in the oblique singular .
Weak masculine tadbhavas , which in Hindī end in a silent consonant , in Kanaujī optionally end in u .
This termination u is optionally retained in the oblique singular , as , ghar-kō or gharu-kō , of a house 
As regards Demonstrative Pronouns , these are , in Standard Hindī , wah and yah , and in Bundēlī , bō and jō .
We sometimes find the past tense of a neuter verb used impersonally with the subject in the agent case .
This is , of course , opposed to the rules of Standard Hindī .
Note how verbs of saying , asking , etc., are used in the feminine of the past tense , agreeing with bāt understood .
The past tenses of dēnā , lēnā and jānā are , as in Bundēlī , daō , laō , gaō .
The past tense of the verb substantive is rahȭ , hatō , or thō .

PRONOUNS .
To any of these plurals hwār or hwāru may be added .
In the personal pronouns , the plural is often used in , the sense of the singular .
The Reflexive Pronoun is āp or āpu , genitive apan , apanu , or ap a nō .
CONJUGATION .

So also , like that dialect , Kanaujī occasionally borrows its definite present from Rājasthānī .
North of the Ganges , as a rule , the two languages gradually merge into each other , and we notice an intermediate dialect , such as , for instance , the Siripuriā of Eastern Purnea , which it is difficult to define either as the one or as the other language .
The District of Malda presents an exception , for , here , we see two , and even three , nationalities living side by side , each adhering to its own form of speech .
For instance , as has already been shown , there is a tract in the Deogarh Sub-division of the Sonthal Parganas , in which both Maithilī and Bengali , besides various Muṇḍā languages , are spoken side by side , without uniting into one general , composite speech .
There it suddenly stops , face to face with the various forms of Bihārī which compose the Aryan speech of the highlands of Chota Nagpur .
These have retained their own language , though , as could only be expected of a small people living for generations in contact with a great people , they have not resisted the temptation of borrowing words and grammatical forms from those amongst whom they live .
It is not , as in the case of Siripuriā , the language of a border tract between a country whose language is Bengali , and a country whose language is Bihārī .
In each case this dialect is the language of a strange people in a strange land .
In Manbhum this language is principally spoken by people of the Kuṛmī caste , who are numerous in the Districts of Chota Nagpur , and in the Orissa Tributary State of Mayurbhanja .
instead of a hard , r .The two quite distinct tribes have been mixed up in the Census , but as their habitats are also distinct , the following figures may be taken as showing with considerable accuracy the number of Kuṛmīs in the area under consideration : These Kuṛmīs do not all speak corrupted Bihārī .
It will thus be understood that the figures for the people speaking it will not agree with those given above for the tribe .
The corrupted dialect has been returned under various names , but in every case it is essentially the same form of speech .
It will be most convenient to call this form of speech ‘ Eastern Magahī ’ for none of the local names applies sufficiently to all the speakers .
In Manbhum and Kharsawan this corrupt Magahī is spoken principally by Kuṛmīs , and is locally known as Kuṛmālī Ṭhāṛ The word ‘ Ṭhār ’ means literally fashion , and the name means the Aryan language as spoken in the Kuṛmālī fashion .
It is , in Manbhum , written in the Bengali character , and this has led to its having been described by some as a dialect of that language .
In the word hĩchhā , for ichchā , a wish , h has been prefixed .
Nouns .
The pleonastic suffix , ṭā , ṭāi or ṭāy is very common .
Sometimes , it has the force of the English definite article .
Its genitive case is ṭek , as in ghaṛi-ṭek bādē , after a space of twenty minutes .
Here it gives the sense of ‘ about ’ .
The syllable ek is added in the sense of the English indefinite article .
Ek-ṭā , is used in the same sense , as in ek-ṭā muniś-kē ḍāki-ke , having called a servant .
In the declension of nouns , the sign for the Accusative-Dative is kē , which belongs both to Bihārī and Bengali .
The Bihārī termination lāy or lāi is also used for the Dative , as in chārāo-lāi , for feeding .
The Genitive has several terminations , viz .
( 1 ) ēṛ This is the regular Bengali termination , as in lakēr , of a man .
This is a Bihārī termination .
This is the commonest termination of all .
If a noun ends in ā there are irregularities .
The Instrumental and Locative , are formed by adding ē .
The Plural is usually the same as the Singular , but in the case of human beings gulā is added .
Thus muniś-gulā-kē , to the servants ; bābu-gulā-k , of the Bābūṣ Pronouns .
The following forms occur : 1st Person , mãy , I ; ma-kē , to me ; mar , my , but hāmar pash , near me ; hāmarā , we ; hāmarā-kē , to us ; hāmarā-kar , of us .
2nd Person , tãy , thou ; tar , thy , but taharē , or tarē , ēsan , like thee .
3rd Person , ū , he ; a-kē , akarā-ke , him ; akar , akarā , his ( the latter only once , agreeing with a nominative plural ) .
The Relative and Correlative Pronouns are j:ē , and sē .
Adjectival pronouns are ahē and sēi , that , and ehē , this .
The Verb .
Singular and Plural are , as a rule , the same .

Before the auxiliary the final l of the Past Participle of an intransitive verb , becomes r .Thus gēr ( for gēl ) rahã , I had gone ; gēr rahē , he had gone .
Past Conjunctive .
As examples of Compound Verbs , we have dēi-delāk , he gave ; dauṛi j:āi-ke , having run , and others .
Idiom The Negative is nehi or nihi .
Example of a Potential Verb , sirāolē pāratāk , they used to be able to finish .
Example of an Inceptive Verb , kere lāgalāk , they began to make .
The following specimens come from Manbhum , and are in the Bengali character .
In its western half its language is Aryan , and towards the east the language is the Tibeto-Burman Kanāwᵃrī or Kanaurī and other connected forms of speech .
It will be seen that the form of jha is the same as that of ja , which is an apt illustration of the tendency in these Pahāṛī languages to drop the aspiration of sonant aspirates ( gha , jha , ḍha , dha , and bha ) : 
Thus , āpṇē is written å .Non-initial long vowels are often represented by their initial forms , and at the same time the letter å is often used as a sort of scaffold on which to build an initial ō .
Instances of the use of initial vowels instead of non-initials are å for lwāṭē and å for gāṇō .
The letter ē is sometimes used instead of i as in å for pākŏṛiyō , and similarly ō is used instead of u , as in å for hāũ .
The letters ē and ai are continually confused , as in å for tēbē .
It will be observed that it only occurs after long vowels , and possibly it may be ( as in Ṭākrī ) merely an indication of length .
As regards consonants , it may be noted that n .is always written with anunāsika ( or , rather , anusvāra instead of anunāsika ) over the preceding vowel .
We have seen how most words written with an aspirated consonant for the first letter , in Kiū~ṭhalī , transfer the aspiration to the end of the first syllable .
In the declension of nouns we have the occasional Sirājī change of ō to ŏ , as in mānsō-rē , of a man , but sū~gŏrŏ-rē , for sū~gŏrō-rē , of the swine .
In other respects the oblique form is made as in Kiū~ṭhalī .
For the personal pronouns there are , as usual , several forms differing slightly from those found in standard Kiū~ṭhalī .
ē or yah , this , has its emphatic form ēī , this very ; and its oblique ( regular ) ӗṣ Sē , he , that , has its agent tēṇē ( tīṇī ) , and its oblique tӗs , tē , or tӗh .
The relative pronoun jē has its agent jē~īē , referring to a goat , and jēṇē ( jīṇī ) , referring to a human being .
The Verb Substantive in the present tense is sō or āsō .
This verb has also a present participle āsdō , and a conjunctive participle āsiyō , with which forms we may compare the Kāshmīrī āsun , to be , which is conjugated throughout .
The conjugation of the active verb calls for few remarks , as it is practically the same as in Kiū~ṭhalī .
The present participle of hōṇū ( hōṇā or hōṇō ) , to be , is hōndā , not hundā .
The past participle of dēṇū ( - ā , - ō ) , to give , is dīṇā ( dēṇō , etc.) 
The conjunctive participle is formed by adding ī ( ē ) or iyō , as in Simla Sirājī .
Inceptive compounds are formed with laggṇū ( past part .
Completive compounds are formed with mukṇū and the conjunctive participle , as in ghŏrchē khā ( i ) yō bēchiyō mukē , ( when ) he had completely eaten and sold the property .
The Pāwᵃrī dialect is a form of Gujarātī Bhīlī .
Their northern origin is confirmed by their language , which has several points of connexion with the Bārēl dialect of Udepur , and with the Bhīl dialects of Rajpipla , Ali Rajpur , and Barwani .
I am able to give two excellent specimens of this dialect , which have been prepared by Mr.G .B .Brahme , First Assistant , Deputy Educational Inspector , Khandesh , and have been checked and supplied with notes by Mr.A .H .A .Simcox , of the Indian Civil Service , to whom I am indebted for much valuable assistance in regard to the Bhīl dialects of Khandesh and Nasik .
The general character of the dialect is well illustrated by the specimens , and I shall here point out only a few characteristic points .
Vowels are often nasalized , as in tu or tũ , thou ; āvē or ā~vē , I shall come .
So also aspiration is lost in words like gōḍō , a horse ; gōr , a house ; bāi , a brother .
Note the frequent use of the suffix lō , which is also found in Ali Rajpur and Chhota Udepur .
This suffix does not seem to affect the meaning .
Nouns .
There are only two genders , the masculine and the feminine , the former being also used as a neuter .
The plurals of strong masculine and feminine bases end in ā and ī , respectively .
The oblique form is the same as in Gujarātī Bhīlī .
The subject of a verb is put in the case of the agent , when the predicate is the past tense of a transitive verb .
The usual case suffixes are , Agent and instrumental , ē .Dative , hā , n , or no suffix .
Ablative dōkh ( not dēkh as elsewhere ) .
Genitive , n .Locative , mē , mā , mā~y , mā~ , ē .
Adjectives follow the Rājasthānī and Gujarātī system of being put into the locative or agent case , when agreeing with a noun in that case .
Numerals .
There are no numerals beyond twenty .
Pronouns .
The demonstrative pronouns are chu , chō , and pōlō , he , that ; fem .
The feminine singular does not occur in the specimens .
Verbs .
The present tense of the verb substantive is chhē , plural also chhētā .
The past tense is ōtō , plural , ōtā .
Finite Verb .
Only a few forms of the old present occur .
The usual form of the present tense is made by adding lō to the present participle ; thus , jāt-lō , goes ; plur .
The past tense is formed by adding yō or lō ; thus , gōyō or gōylō , he went ; pōḍyō or pōḍlō , he fell .
The future is formed by adding hē or i in the singular , and hũ or ũ and hōt in the plural .
Another future ends in ṇē or nē~ and thus has the same form as the infinitive ; thus , jāṇē or jāṇē~ , I shall go , I am off ; āpṇē , if I give .
The plural of the imperative ends in ā or ō ; thus , bōhāṭā , strike ; nākhō , put .
The verbal noun ends in ṇē and the conjunctive participle in i or in ; thus , rākhṇē-n , for keeping ; āpi , having given ; kōrin , having done .
The suffix ān , i.e.
probably ā~ , is used to indicate an object of the first person singular in pī-ān , give me .
The forms yē , in-chhūng and in-ngā , it is , yes , seem to show that the base alone , and with one of the suffixes chhūng and ngā , can be used as a present .
The mere base is also used as an imperative ; thus , nē , take ; mō , do .
Other imperatives are formed by adding ō , ū , and ā ; thus , chō , eat ; dūng-ū , drink ; yosu , strike ; ipsā sleep ; bānā , come , etc.
We do not know anything about the meaning of the consonants preceding the final vowel of such imperatives .
The negative particle is a prefixed mā or man ; thus , mā-nā , not-is , no ; man-duwako , not ripe , raw .
Hodgson also mentions a negative suffix īsi .
The negative with imperatives is na .
AUTHORITIES Hodgson , B .H ., Continuation of the Comparative Vocabulary of the several Dialects of the Kirăntes Language .
Lōhōrōng is most closely related to Bālāli and connected dialects .
Nouns .
The prefix ūm in ūm ’ pā , faher ; ūm ’ mā , mother , etc., is identical with the pronoun ūm , his , her , its .
Gender is distinguished by using different words or by adding suffixes or words such as ūm ’ pā , umprūpa , male ; ūm ’ mā , ummrūma , female .
There are three numbers , the singular , the dual , and the plural .
The suffix chi is said to be used both in the dual and in the plural ; thus , mik ’ , eye , dual and plural mi ’ chi .
In the case of adjectives we find a dual suffix chia and a separate plural suffix miha ; thus , nūyē , good , dual nuk-chia , plural nuk-miha .
The genitive is expressed by putting the governed before the governing word without any suffix ; thus , pi ’ pasā , cow ’ s young , calf .
If the governing word is understood , the suffix mi is added ; thus , kāngā-mi , mine .
Other relations are indicated by adding postpositions , such as be , bī , in ; bāng , pāng , from ; ē , yē , by ; nūng , with , and so on .
Numerals .
The first numerals are given in the table on p .342 .
The forms ending in pang , bang , are used when the qualified noun denotes male or female 
individuals , those ending in chi are neuter .
It will be seen that higher numbers are counted in tens .
Pronouns .
The following are the personal pronouns : It will be seen that the dual and the plural are confounded in the third person , as in the case of nouns .
It looks as if the dual were gradually giving way to the plural .
Mō , he , is also used as a demonstrative pronoun meaning ‘ that ’ .
The corresponding nearer demonstrative is īgo , this .
The real base is ī , and the suffix go can also be added to mō ; thus , mōgo-chi , they .
The dual of īgo is given as iga-chi , these two .
Interrogative pronouns are āsā , who ?
They can be changed to indefinite pronouns by adding sāng ; thus , āsā-sāng , anyone ; imāng-sāng , anything .
Verbs .
The subject of the verb is probably indicated by adding pronominal suffixes ; thus , limuk-nga , I am sweet ; khik-nga and khik-ti-nga , I am bitter ; dūng-ē , drink thou ; dūnga-che , drink ye two ; dūnga-ne , drink ye .
There seems to be a suffix nga denoting a subject of the first person singular .
In the imperative , a dual or plural subject is indicated by adding che , ne , respectively .
Those forms are identical with the dual and plural suffix of personal pronouns .
An m is sometimes inserted before the n of the plural ; thus , sede , kill ; seda-che , kill ye two ; sedam-ne , kill ye .
A suffix ng is also used to denote an object of the first person ; thus , pī-ng-ē , give me .
The t in pit-t-ē , give him , is perhaps a corresponding suffix of the third person .
Forms such as mō nū , that is good ; īgo nū , this is good ; medding , it is not , show that the base alone can be used as a present .
We have no other information about the formation of the various tenses .
The suffix of the imperative is e , dual a-che , plural a-ne or am-ne ; thus , dābe , come ; dāba-che , come ye two ; dābā-ne , come ye ; lome , strike ; loma-che , strike ye two ; lomam-ne , strike ye .
Causals are formed by suffixing mette ; thus , dung-mette , cause him to drink ; im-mette , cause him to sleep .
The negative particle is apparently a prefixed me ; thus , medding , not-is , without .
A suffixed ni is used in words such as nā-ni , good-not .
A negative imperative is formed by prefixing e ’ ; thus , e ’ - dūbe and e ’ - tōnge , do not make .
AUTHORITY Hodgson , B .H ., Continuation of the Comparative Vocabulary of the several Dialects of the Kirăntee Language .
Nouns .
The prefix ī and īm in words such as ī-chhā and chhā , child ; ī-thin and thin , egg ; ī-lēmba , day ; īm-pā , father ; īm-mā , mother , etc., is by origin a pronoun ; compare īm , his , her , its .
Gender is distinguished by using different terms , or else by adding suffixes or words indicating the sex .
We have no information about the suffixes added in the dual and the plural .
The suffix chhi in chhā-chhi , child ; pā-chhi , mau ; mā-chhi , woman , is perhaps a dual suffix .
The genitive is expressed by putting the governed before the governing word and inserting the possessive pronoun corresponding to the former before the latter ; thus , pit ’ ī-chhā , cow its-young , calf ; sing-ī-tāngli , wood-its-plant , tree .
The possessive pronoun can be dropped ; thus , tang phūkwa , head hair , the hair of the head ; wā-thin , bird ’ s egg .
The suffix khā , of , is probably identical with the final kha in numerous adjectives , such as nūyukkha , good ; kūyū-kha , hot , etc.
Ngāka , of , is perhaps miswritten for ngākhā , and contains the suffix ngā , by .
The number of speakers is estimated to be 2 , 428 .
It will be sufficient to give one specimen of it , a version of the Parable of the Prodigal Son , and a brief account of the principal points in which the Grammar differs from that of Standard Kiū~ṭhalī .
On the other hand in bhūkhāī , by hunger , we have ī used instead of ē , the termination of the instrumental .
Similarly , the confounding of the letters ā , ō , and ū is very common .
The termination of the Genitive is either rō or rā , and that of the Ablative is dā , dō , dū .
As examples of the metathesis of the letter h , we may quote āhth , a hand , and gŏhr , a house .
In Kiū~ṭhalī the oblique form of masculine nouns ending in consonants is made by adding ō .
The same termination is even added to a noun ending in a vowel , in mū~ŏ , ( before thy ) face .
The Genitive takes rā ( rō ) as usual .
For the Dative , besides khē ( with its variant khī ) , we have also khū , kū~ , kāē , and the Sirājī kē .
For the Ablative , besides dā ( dō , dū ) , there are khū and kiū~ .
For the Locative there is the usual dā ( dō ) .
For the Personal Pronouns there are several forms .
We may note : The Demonstratives are .
No feminine forms have been noted , but they doubtless exist , as in the Standard .
The Relative pronoun is jun .
or jō , declined like sē .
The Verb Substantive has many forms for the present .
The Singular and Plural are the same , and so are the second and third persons .
The Past is thō or thiyō .
The Active Verb shows few irregularities , and most of these are matters of spelling .
Irregular past participles noted are dīṇā ( ō ) , given ; gōā or gō , gone ; rŏā ( ō ) , remained ; and uā ( ō ) , become .
The Present Participle is , as usual , employed as an infinitive of purpose , as in chārdō chhāṛō , sent him to feed ( swine ) .
The Present is thus conjugated : I strike , etc.
For the Past Conditional , we have rŏndō thiyō , I might have remained .
The following forms have been noted for the Future Masculine : ‘ I shall strike , ’ etc.
The Past is quite regular , and need not detain us .
For Compound Verbs , we have : Intensives , such as mŏrē ( for mŏrī ) gō-thō ; ōē ( for hōī ) gō .
Inceptives are formed with the Present Participle , as in rŏndō lāgō , he began to remain .
The Gujurī of Swat has two sub-dialects , Gujurī and Ajṛī .
Ajṛī is the language of the Ajaṛs , a tribe closely allied to the Gujurs , and inhabiting some six hundred hamlets in the Swat Valley .
We shall first deal with Gujurī proper , the dialect of the Gujurs .
These cowherds wander through the Yūsufzai country on the North-West Frontier south of Swat , and their language is often differentiated as ‘ Yūsufzai Gujurī ’ .
As may be expected , these Gujurs frequently make use of Puṣh.tōwords and phrases , but their language , like that of other Gujurs , is closely allied to Mēwātī and Mēwāṛī .
The following grammatical sketch illustrates the grammar used by these Gujurs in its pure form ; but many deflections from rule will be noticed in the specimens , due to the influence of the neighbouring Puṣh.tōand Western Pañjābī languages .

Irregular Past Participles Imperatives .
The following points may be noted in regard to the grammar of the specimens : I .NOUNS .
The Agent case is generally the same as the Nominative .
Indeed the use of the Agent with the Past tense of a Transitive verb seems to have almost disappeared .
In the case of nouns in ō , the oblique form singular usually ends in ā , but sometimes , probably owing to careless speaking , the direct form is used ; thus , ghōṛō-kō , of a horse , instead of the more correct ghōṛā-kō ; mandō ( for mandā ) kam-mā~ ; mairō bāp-kā , for mairā bāp-kā .
Sometimes , under the influence of Pañjābī , the oblique form ends in ē .
On the other hand , the influence of Pañjābī sometimes makes these nouns form the direct form in ā instead of in ō .
The following are examples of the correct use of the direct and oblique forms : mairō pūt mōyō thō ( Hindī , mērā pūt muā thā ) , my son was dead ; apṇā mā-tah ( Hindī , apnē māl-sē ) , from his own share ; chaṅgā admī ( Hindī , chaṅgē ādmī ) , good men ; is-kā pairā~-mā~ ( Hindī , is-kē pairȭ-mē~ ) , on his feet ; apṇā dōstā~-kanah ( Hindī , apnē dōstȭ-sāth ) , with ( my ) own friends : chaṅgī trīmat ( Hindī , chaṅgī strī ) , a good woman ; is-kī aṅgṛī-mā~ ( Hindī , is-kī angulī-mē~ ) , on his finger .
PRONOUNS .
The proper form of the Agent of hū~ is maĩ .
An example of the Agent of the second person is taĩ-nī ditō hai ( Hindī , tū-nē nahĩ diyā hai ) , by thee has not been given .
So for the third person usā baṇḍiō ( Hindī , us-nē bā~ṭā ) , by him was divided ; us kahiō ( Hindī , us-nē kahā ) , by him it was said ; but ōh ( not us or usā ) uṭhiō ( Hindī , wah uṭhā ) , he rose .
The Relative Pronoun chi is borrowed from Puṣh.tō.
VERBS .
In the conjugation of verbs , the method of forming the Present Definite and Imperfect should be noted .
Here the verb exactly follows the Mēwātī custom .
To form these tenses , the auxiliary verb is added , not to the Present Participle , but to the various persons of the simple Present Tense .
Other examples are karū~ hai , I am making , used as a present subjunctive , ( that ) I may make ( merriment with my friends ) ; karū~ thō , I was making .
The Present Participle is used to form a Habitual Past .
In the Simple Present , which is also used as a present subjunctive , there are some irregularities observable in the specimens .
In ham kh u sh ālī karū~ , kh u sh āl hū~ , the first person singular is used for the first person plural .
Pañjābī is responsible for khā-laĩ , and hō jāyaĩ , and also for khāi ( they eat ) , in which last the singular is used for the plural .
As already observed , the use of the Passive construction of the Past Tense of Transitive verbs appears to be dying out .
The Agent form of the personal pronouns is still usually employed before these tenses , but all traces of the Agent case have disappeared from the noun .
The feeling for gender , too , is very weak .
The main dialect of the State of Chamba is known as Chamĕāḷī , and is a form of Western Pahāṛī .
In the west of the state towards Jammu we find a dialect called Bhaṭĕālī spoken by an estimated number of 14,000 people .
It is a kind of Ḍōgrā , but like Kāṅgrā is a mixed form of speech .
T.Grahame Bailey gives an account of this dialect in his Languages of the Northern Himalayas ( London , 1908 ) , and the following sketch of its main peculiarities is based upon this , with a few additions collected from the annexed specimen , a version of the Parable of the Prodigal Son .
This is given in facsimile , in the local Ṭākrī character , the transliteration being arranged line for line with the original , with the very careless spelling usual in writing in this character made uniform , so as to agree with that of the grammatical sketch .
Declension .
With the above exception of the change of e to ē , which is , in this case , little more than a question of spelling , the formation of the oblique form of masculine nouns is much the same as in Kāṅgrā .
The case of the agent is also very similar .
Thus : It will be noted that the agent plural is always the same as the oblique plural .
The case postpositions are .
While the oblique form singular of nouns corresponding to ghar usually ends in ē , it sometimes ends in ā , so that from mulkh , a country , we have both mulkhē and mulkhā .
Feminine nouns in ī sometimes drop the final ā of the oblique singular , as in surtī-vichch instead of surtīā-vichch , in memory .
The Pronouns present a few departures from the Ḍōgrā and Kāṅgrā Standards .
The Personal Pronouns are as follows .
In the ablative , as usual , we may have kichhā instead of kachhā .
For the third person and demonstrative pronouns , we have In the genitive , we have uddā as well as us-dā .
Other pronouns are kōī , some one , any one ; kichchh , something , anything .
Conjugation .
The verb substantive closely follows Kāṅgrā .
Thus : Present , I am , etc.
The Past is thā , fem .
The Active verb follows Kāṅgrā .
Thus : Present Subjunctive ( mārnā , to strike ) .
Future masc .
This tense does not change for person .
The feminine is formed in the usual way .
Mr.Grahame Bailey gives the present tense as formed in the usual way , by suffixing the verb substantive to the present participle ; thus , mārdā-hā~ , I strike .
But , in the specimen , there is another present tense , in nā , resembling the infinitive in form .
It will be remembered that the Ḍōgrā present participle may end in nā .
The following are examples of irregular verbs : Note the short a in ayā , jandā , jaṅghā , and galayā .
The Gujarātī spoken by the educated classes of the Peninsula of Kathiawar is , as usual , the standard dialect .
The uneducated Hindus , on the other hand , speak a well defined dialect , known as K āṭhiyāwāḍī or Kāṭhīāwāḍī .
Most of the Musalmāns speak Hindōstānī , but some of them , especially the sailors for whom Kathiawar is famous , speak a broken kind of Gujarātī which will be dealt with separately Local authorities divide Kāthiyāwāḍī into four sub-dialects , Jhālāwād .
There is the usual uncertain vowel scale .
The past participle of jaw ũ , to go , is always written jīy ô , although the ō in other past participles is written as in the standard ; thus , hatō ( not hat ô ) , was ; paḍyō ( not paḍy ô ) , fallen : .
At the commencement of a word , s is aspirated and # written in the vernacular # which bears the same relation to # s , that # kh , does to # k .
The letter h , when medial , is elided .
The letter l .usually becomes r .
A final vowel is optionally nasalized .
Declension .
There are a good many irregularities in the declension of nouns .
As in Surᵃtī , nouns ending in consonants take ā in the oblique form singular and in the plural ( in the plural also ā~ ) .
Another oblique form is made by adding ya .
It is used in both numbers .
The plural is also indicated by the addition of ũ .
The ē of the agent-locative is often nasalized .
Pronouns .
The first two personal pronouns are as in standard Gujarātī .
The locative of the genitive may be used as a dative .
The pronoun of the third person is tē , tī , or ī .
All these forms are declined regularly , except that the nominative plural of ī may be īwaḍāi .
The case of the agent has a dental n , as in īnē by ( as well as , to ) him .
’ The word bhaī , is also employed with a pronoun of the third person .
Conjugation .
As usual in North Gujarat , the second person singular is the same as the first person .
In other respects the conjugation of the verb closely follows the standard dialect , allowing for phonetic changes .
The present tense of the verb substantive is as follows .
The past tense is hatō or tō , as in other northern Gujarat dialects .
The present tense of the finite verb is : I strike .
The auxiliary is often written with chh .
The past participle is māryō .
The future is as in the standard dialect .
The imperative ends in ya .
The past participle of verbs the roots of which end in ā ( passives ) takes the termination ṇō .
The verb jaw ũ , to go , has its present participle jätō , not jatō , and its past tense jīy ô .
Similarly , thaw ũ , to be , has its infinitive thāw ũ , and its present participle thātō .
Forms such as kwān , Tibetan gon , cloth ; chā , Tibetan za , eat ; pli and bli , Tibetan bzhi , four ; pre and bre , Tibetan brgyad , eight , and so forth , in which hard and soft consonants interchange , seem to show that the soft consonants of Tibetan have developed into soft aspirates , and further into hard sounds .
The final consonants of classical Tibetan have been retained to a greater extent than is the case in Gurung .
There are several compound consonants such as kl , gl , pl , bl , ml , kr , gr , pr , br , mr , ky , gy , jy , and so forth .
We have no information about tones or accentuation .
There are no articles , but the numeral ki , gi , one , is often used as a kind of indefinite article ; thus , ā-bā-ki , a father ; jhyā-bā ki mhi , a good man ; ki jhyā-bā mi-lā , of a good man .
It will be seen that ki sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the qualified noun .
Nouns .
The prefix ā is common in words denoting relationship ; thus , ā-bā , father ; ā-mā , mother ; ā-lā , younger brother ; ā-ngā , younger sister ; ā-gu , uncle .
Gender .
The natural gender can be distinguished by using different words or by adding words such as hvā-bā , male ; me and māmā , female ; thus , mhi , man ; mring-kolā , woman : jhā , son ; jha-me , daughter : tā , horse ; tā-māmā , mare .
If it is necessary to distinguish the plural , words such as kāde , kāte , or gāde , many ; dugu ( Tibetan dgu ) , many , are added .
The subject of intransitive verbs and the object are not distinguished by adding any suffix .
The subject of transitive verbs is usually put in the case of the agent , which is formed by adding se ; thus , chāng-bā-se pān-ji , the younger-by said , the younger said .
The same suffix is also used to denote the instrument .
nyāī , by me , seems to show that the suffix of this case is originally s , which has become i after a preceding vowel .
The suffix of the dative is dā or tā ; thus , ā-bā ki-dā , to a father ; chākara-tā , to a servant .
This form is sometimes also used as an accusative ; thus , the-lā jha-tā rop-chi , his son-to struck , I have beaten his son .
The suffix of the genitive is lā ; compare Gurung .
A locative and terminative is formed by adding ri as in Gurung ; thus , yāmbunāg-ri , in a city ; dim-ri , in the house ; khāre-ri , upon the neck .
Other relations are indicated by adding postpositions .
Some postpositions are added to the genitive ; thus , li-chhā and li-sang , behind ; ngā-chhā , behind ; nindi-ri , for the sake of .
A suffix b or p of uncertain meaning occurs in several words such as cheta-p ta-si-jin-ji , having come to senses ; chhuṭya-p la-si , division making ; lhābā-b tā-ji , engaged ; mānasi-b tā-si , it became proper ; pheriā-b ā-si , coming outside ; uḍa-b lā-si , squandered .
Adjectives .
Adjectives sometimes precede and sometimes follow the noun they qualify .
There are , however , also other suffixes in use ; thus , ā-khām-na , unable ; kyāng-no , all ; thā-cho , straight ; kok-teng , crooked ; mlāngai , black ; tāra , white ; bāla , red .
The particle of comparison is given as oisi ; thus , the-lā ā-le the-lā ā-ngā oisi no-bā mu-lā , his brother is taller than his sister .
Numerals .
The first numerals are given in the list of words .
They sometimes precede and sometimes follow the noun they qualify .
The higher numbers are counted in twenties .
The list of numerals just mentioned , however , gives ngi-seb , twenty ; som-seb , thirty ; pli-seb , forty ; ngā-seb , fifty ; ṭu-seb , sixty ; nis-seb , seventy ; bre-seb , eighty ; ku-seb , ninety ; chiu-seb , hundred .
Pronouns .
Pronouns are inflected like nouns .
The principal forms of the personal pronouns will be seen from the table which follows .
Demonstrative pronouns are chu , this ; the , u-chu , ho-ju , ho-jā , that .
Interrogative pronouns are khā and hālā , who ?
By adding the indefinite particle nu or no indefinite pronouns are effected ; thus , khāl-che-nu , by anyone ; tiki-no , anything ; khāi-mā-ye-no , ever .
Note also the reflexive pronoun rāng-lā or rhāng-lā , own .
Verbs .
The verb is still virtually a noun .
The suffix m in forms such as pin-ji-m , he gave , in the Darjeeling specimens , is perhaps a corresponding suffix of the third person .
It is , however , more probable that this m is simply the verb substantive .
The use of pronominal suffixes is , at all events , no regular feature of Murmi , though it is possible that there is a tendency to distinguish the various persons of the verb .
It is also possible to suggest the influence of other dialects in which the use of personal suffixes is quite regular .
Verb substantive .
The usual base of the verb substantive is mu , present mu-lā , past mu-bā .
Other forms are supplied from other bases such as tā , to become ; re , to stand .
we have a base ni .
Another base ke apparently occurs in ye-lā-ke , it is thine .
Finite verbs .
The verb substantive is freely used in the formation of the tenses of finite verbs .
Present time .
The base alone is sometimes used as a present tense .
The most common suffix of the present is apparently lā ; thus , mu-lā , am ; rop-lā , strike .
The suffix pā or bā in forms such as the-se rop-pā , he strikes ; chhā-se chi-bā , having grazed sits , he is grazing , corresponds to Tibetan pa or ba and does not contain any special notion of time .
Forms such as si-la-ji , I die ; ha-ji , he comes ; rop-chi , thou strikest ; ngā-ni ni-sai , we go , and so forth , apparently contain the same suffix as that which is generally used with the meaning of a past .
A similar use of the suffix of past time is not uncommon in connected forms of speech .
It is perhaps due to the intention of the speaker to represent the action of the verb as an established fact .
Past time .
The usual suffix of past time is ji as in Gurung ; thus , pān-ji , he said ; ni-ji , he went .
Chi is perhaps the correct form after hard consonants .
Such forms are apparently only used in the third person .
The present suffix lā is also used with the meaning of a future ; thus , pāng-lā , I shall say .
Forms such as majā-laī , let us make merry , are perhaps imperative .
Imperative .
The usual suffixes of the imperative are u or o and go ; thus , chā-u , eat ; re-go , stand ; rob-ko , beat .
Other sources also give imperatives such as rob , beat ; yar , run , and so forth , where no suffix is added .
Verbal nouns and participles .
The usual verbal noun ends in bā ; thus , chhā-bā , to graze ; khā-bā-se , by his coming , because he came ; khā-bā-chhyām , coming-with , when he came ; mrin-bā-ri , filling to , to fill .
The base alone is also used as a verbal noun ; thus , chā ā-khām-na , to-eat unable .
Other verbal nouns are formed by adding lā , nu , sam , and si ; thus , tā-lā , to be ; tā-sam ( Darjeeling ) , to be ; lā-nu ( Darjeeling ) , to make ; lā-si , to make .
Tā-lā , to be , is perhaps a genitive .
Forms such as tā-lā jhin-ji , having been , perhaps contain the same suffix and a postposition jhin-ji , finishing , from , after .
Compare , however , the suffix lā of the present and future .
The form ending in bā is also used as a relative participle ; thus , ḍarmā-ri ṭi-bā chākara-dugu , wages-in living servants , hired servants .
Another suffix used to form relative participles is nā ; thus , yennā sampati chā-si pin-nā chu yennā kolā , your property having-eaten giving this your son ; this your son who wasted your property .
The suffix nā is also used to form a kind of adverbial participle .
Other adverbial participles are formed from the various verbal nouns by adding postpositions ; thus , pāng-mā , saying in , while saying ; pāng-min , while saying ; bi-se , by saying , if you say .
Forms such as si-bāng , dead ; mā-bāng , lost , probably contain the suffix bā mentioned in the preceding .
A particle nā or nām is sometimes added ; thus , rup-si-nā , gathering ; khā-ji-nām , coming , in the Darjeeling specimens .
Passive voice .
There is no passive voice .
It is perhaps a verb substantive .
It is formed from chā-bā , to eat , by aspirating the initial consonant .
Negative particle .
The negative particle is a prefixed ā , and ni or na is usually added to the base ; thus , ā-pin-ni , did not give ; ā-yo-na , did not get .
In chhyāng-do-lā , did not transgress , the negative particle must be contained in the o preceding the lā , or else chhyāng-do-lā means ‘ obeyed ’ .
Note forms such as krā-bā ā-hin , crying was-not , I did not cry , where the negative has been prefixed to the auxiliary and not to the principal verb .
The usual order of words is subject , object , verb .
A list of Standard Words and Phrases from the Nepal Darbar will be found on pp .
It is usually called Dēśī , that is the language of the Dēś , the country par excellence .
Territory where spokeṇThe frontiers within which this form of Marāṭhī is spoken coincide with those given for the whole language towards the north .
Towards the west it gradually merges into the Konkan form of the language in the hilly country which separates the Konkan from the Dekhan .
These mixed forms of speech will be dealt with in connection with the Marāṭhī of the Konkan .
The Dekhan form of the language is also spoken in the towns of Bijapur , the chief language of which district is Kanarese , and , to some extent , in Dharwar .
In Baroda it is the language of the court , and is spoken by the following numbers in the different districts : Number of speakerṣThe revised figures for the districts where it is spoken as a vernacular were reported for this Survey as follows .
It is probable that much of this total in reality refers to a form of speech similar to that current in the Konkan .
The difference between the two dialects is not , however , so important that any serious disadvantage will arise from the whole total being put down as belonging to Dēśī .
The Dēśī form of the language is also to some extent spoken by the educated classes all over the Marāṭhī territory , and by settlers from the Dekhan throughout India .
The speakers of Marāṭhī in those parts of India where it is not a vernacular have been returned as speaking Marāṭhī , without mention of sub-dialect .
Standard Marāṭhī in the Dekhan form , has , however , been reported from several districts outside the territory where that dialect is spoken as a vernacular .
The ensuing estimates of the number of speakers have been forwarded by the local authorities , In Berar , where a slightly different dialect is current in most districts , settlers from the Dekhan have brought the Standard form of the language with them .
The revised figures are as follows , In the Central Provinces the language of Poona and surrounding districts is sometimes called Punēkarī .
Though the Bhonslas of Nagpur afterwards held sway over the country from 1791 till it was annexed by the British in 1818 , the Marāṭhī of those districts is still the Dekhan form of the language .
The form mī is used in addition to myā~ as the case of the agent of the personal pronoun of the first person ; thus , mī pāp kēlē~ āhē , by-me sin done is .
Transitive verbs add s in the second person singular of the past tense ; thus , tvā~ , or tū~ , karᵃḍū~ hī dilē~-nāhī~s , by-thee a-kid even was-not-given-by-thee ; mōṭhī jēvᵃṇāvaḷ kēlīs , a-great feast was-made-by-thee , thou gavest a great feast .
There are no instances of the use of the first person neuter and the third person feminine singular of the present tense .
Thus , yētē~ , I ( neuter ) come ; yētē , she comes .
The usual forms in the Dekhan are yētȭ , I ( neuter ) come ; yētī , she comes .
In all other respects the specimens well represent the language of Marāṭhī literature .
The real home language is the Marāṭhī dialect of the Central and Northern Konkan .
The usual Dekhan form of the language is , however , spoken by about 80,000 people .
The principal language of Thana is the dialect of Marāṭhī which , with slight local variations , is spoken from Daman to Rajapur .
The principal language of Nasik is Marāṭhī , shading off into Khāndēśī in the north .
This latter language is spoken in the north , on the Khandesh border , where we also find a Bhīl dialect .
It has hitherto been classed as a dialect of Marāṭhī .
The materials collected for the Linguistic Survey , however , show that it is rather a dialect of Gujarātī , and it will therefore be dealt with in connection with that language .
It is , however , almost certain that it does not materially differ from the form which that language assumes in the neighbouring Ahmadnagar .
Specimens have been forwarded of two border dialects , spoken in the west of the district .
The former is a Bhīl dialect , and the latter will be dealt with in connection with the Marāṭhī spoken in the Central and Northern Konkan .
Above the hills , however , the difference between the two forms of speech is so unimportant that no inconvenience can possibly arise from the Nasik dialect being classed under the standard form of Marāṭhī current in the Dekhan .
To the south of Nasik lies the district of Ahmadnagar , the principal language of which is Marāṭhī .
It is the usual Dekhan form of that language , and it is not necessary to illustrate it further .
Marāṭhī is further spoken all over the Bhor State as the principal language .
We may only note that t is often added to the second person plural of the past tense of intransitive verbs .
In Sholapur the same form of Marāṭhī is the principal language in the north and the west .
Marāṭhī is also the principal language of the northern part of the Akalkot State and of Pilio and Kurla of the same State .
The language of the rest of the State is Kanarese .
The principal language of the Satara District , as also of the States Phaltan and Audh in the Satara Agency is Marāṭhī with the usual characteristics of the Dekhan .
Of the 59,500 speakers in the Phaltan State about 56,000 are stated to be Kuṇᵃbīṣ Their dialect does not , however , differ from that of the rest of the population .
The principal language of Belgaum is Kanarese .
The dialect of Belgaum closely agrees with that of Satara .
The numeral ‘ one ’ is written yēk , a state of affairs which is common in many parts of the territory in which Marāṭhī is a vernacular .
The verb hōṇē~ , to become , forms the past tense dzāhᵃlā , where Standard has dzhālā .
Such discrepancies are , however , not sufficiently important to make it necessary to give any specimen of the dialect .
The dialect closely agrees with that of Satara .
Marāṭhī is also the main language of Kolhapur .
The dialect shows all the characteristics of the form of Marāṭhī spoken in Satara .
In other respects the dialect does not differ from that current in neighbouring districts .
The only peculiarity is that a ta is added in the second person plural of the past tense .
They all exhibit the same form of the language as that current in Satara and neighbouring districts .
The second person singular of the past tense of transitive verbs only occasionally adds s.The only other peculiarity which needs be mentioned is the preference shown for the word avaghā , all .
Closely related is also the dialect exhibited in the specimens received from Ramdrug .
Their number is estimated to be between 500 and 1 , 000 .
Two specimens and a list of standard words and phrases have been prepared by Babu Bisharup Singh in the Pūrūm village in the valley of Manipur .
It is , however , more closely connected with such languages as Hallām , Langrong , Rāngkhōl , etc.
It is often almost impossible to state whether a vowel is long or short .
An accented final vowel is probably long , but is shortened when the stress is transferred to another syllable .
We have , however , no information as to where the stress should come , and the marking of long vowels by the original writer being rather inconsistent , it is impossible to state the rules for the shortening .
Diphthongs occur very frequently , but they are , in most cases , interchangeable with single vowels .
Thus , we find ma-nūi and ma-ni , they ; ngāi and ngē , to wish ; yaū , yo , and yūi , a suffix of the past tense ; amoi and amo , the interrogative particle , etc.
Hard and soft consonants are sometimes interchangeable .
Thus , sa-nāū-pā and sa-nāū-bā , son ; pi-nū and bi-nū , a female suffix ; kai-chū , I ; mo-jū , he , etc.
S and y are apparently used alternatively in the suffix of the past tense , yaū , yo , and saū , so .
The same suffix is once also written cho .
S is perhaps , in this case , written for z , y and z being interchangeable in many connected languages .
Compare Meithei , where r is substituted for l after a vowel .
Kh and h are apparently interchangeable in the numeral a-khā , one .
A final ng seems often only to mark a nasal pronunciation of the preceding vowel .
Prefixes and Suffixes .
There are apparently only few prefixes , and no suffixes used in the same otiose way as in the Nāgā languages .
A is prefixed to nouns and adjectives ; thus , a-pā , a man ; a-pā-o , O father ; a-hong , neck ; a-lā , far ; a-nāy-ā , near ; a-tam , many .
This prefix is sometimes the possessive pronoun of the third person ; thus , a-kūt-ā , his-hand-on , but has usually been superseded as such by ma .
A prefix beginning with k occurs in forms such as ka-don , whatever ; ko-tā , saying ; and kolhā in kai ka-wēl kolhā , I may strike .
Ma is usually the possessive pronoun of the third person , but is also used in a wider sense ; thus , ma-khai , whatever ; ma-tik , worthy , etc.
Articles .
There are no articles .
The numeral a-khā , one , is used as an Indefinite article , while relative clauses , pronominal prefixes , and demonstrative pronouns supply the place of a Definite article .
Nouns .
The prefixes a and ma which occur in the list of words before nouns of relationship are the possessive pronoun of the third person .
Compare , however , Prefixes and Suffixes , above .
Gender is only apparent in the case of animate beings and is only marked when it does not appear from the context .
It is distinguished by means of suffixes , and , in the case of human beings , also by the use of different words .
The usual suffixes , in the case of human beings , are pā , male , and nū , female .
In mi a-khā-pā , a man , the suffix pā is added to the numeral a-khā , one .
The gender of animals is distinguished by the suffixes pā , a-pā , chal-pā , and tang-pā , for males , and namai , a-mai , pi-nū , and bi-nū , for females .
The suffixes chal-pā , tang-pā , and pi-nū or bi-nū , are compound suffixes .
Chal is a male suffix in Hallām , Langrong , and other dialects ; tang is used alone in Kolrēn , and is probably identical with tong in haū-tong , a cat ; pi or pūi is a very common female suffix in Meithei , Kolrēn , Siyin , Hallām , Langrong , etc.
To these are added the suffixes pā and nū respectively .
Number .
There are two numbers , the singular and the plural .
Case .
The Nominative and Accusative do not require any suffix .
It marks the personal object with causative verbs ; thus , kai-ta sē-lo na-sūk a-khā chang-pi , me hired thy-servant one to-be-cause ; a-pā a-khā-dā ron-pi-so , man one to-wear-hecaused .
The suffix of the agent is nā ; thus , ma-pā-nā ma-ral sam-sū-so , his father his-pro-perty divided .
Nā is often added to the subject of an intransitive verb .
This nā is perhaps different word , and is probably the demonstrative pronoun nā , this .
The Genitive is expressed by putting the governed before the governing noun , without any suffix .
The stem alone , or with an o added , is used as a Vocative ; thus ka-sa-nāū , my son ; a-pā-o , O father .
Adjectives .
Adjectives are often preceded by the prefix a ; thus , a-lā , far ; a-ngaū-pā , white .
The suffix pā , forming relative participles , is often added .
When the adjectives are used as verbs the ordinary verbal suffixes are added .
Adjectives usually follow , but sometimes also precede the noun they qualify .
The postpositions kārā , from among , and ta , concerning , are used as particles of comparison , and tik or tik-ti may be added to the adjective .
The Numerals are given in the list of words .
They follow the noun they qualify .
There are no traces in the specimens of the use of generic prefixes .
Pronouns .
The following are the Personal pronouns : Singular , Plural , Words such as chū or jū , that ; ko , that , also , are often added to the pronouns in order to emphasise them ; thus , kai-chū , I ; mo-jū , he ; kai-ko , I , etc.
A suffix in is added to the nominative in a few instances in the list .
The possessive pronouns ka , my ; na , thy ; a and ma , his , are used in the genitive , but also the fuller forms .
The plural of the second person is nangai , i.e.
Demonstrative pronouns .
There are no Relative pronouns .
The suffix pā , which often is added to adjectives , belongs to a relative participle .
But in most cases no suffix is added .
Interrogative pronounṣ A-tū , who ?
Another interrogative pronoun occurs in na-ming alo tiyāmē , what is thy name ?
The base of the interrogative pronoun tū is also used as an indefinite pronoun .
Verbs .
Verbs are not conjugated in person and number .
Ka , my , and a , his , are in a few instances used before the verb in order to denote the person of the subject .
The root alone , without any suffix , is freely used to denote present and past times .
The suffix ā , which usually forms adverbial clauses and conjunctive participles , may be added , apparently without changing the meaning .
A suffix sā occurs in forms such as chang-sā , it is ; a-thiyang-sā , he was dead ; a-māng-sā , he was lost .
It is perhaps identical with the suffix of the past tense .
It seems to be an assertive suffix , compare Burmese chhē ( pronounced s ’ ä ) .
The usual suffix of the past is yaū , yo , or yūi .
All these suffixes seem to be derived from a common source , probably a verb yaū or zaū , to finish , to complete .
It is worth noting , however , that soi or sŭi is a sign of the past tense in Bodo languages .
The s-suffix is , therefore , perhaps different from the y-suffix , and should be compared with the suffix sang in Lai , and song in Tibetan .
Compare also Compound verbs , below .
Other suffixes of the past are pi-yaū , pi-yo , pi-yang , si-yang , si-yā and sēng .
Siyang , siyā and sēng seem to contain a verb si , perhaps meaning ‘ to be ’ .
Piyaū , piyo , and piyang seem to contain a verb pi .
All these forms are , therefore , probably no real past tenses , but compound verbs .
A Present Definite seems to be formed by adding ang or ing ; thus , pi-yang-ē , he is giving ; kai-nā wēl-song-ing , I am striking ; and probably also kai thēng-song-ing , I 
This tense may also be formed , in a periphrastic way , by means of the verb am , to be , to remain .
The usual suffix of the Future is ang , as in Lushēi and partly in Khongzāi .
Another suffix is tik , in ril-thing-tik-ē , I will say ; sa-wāi lūko bak-ā won hop-tik-ē tā ning-ting-a-chaū , ‘ husks even eating belly fill-will ’ saying wishing-after-even , though he wished to fill his belly even with husks .
Chaū in this last instance is probably the demonstrative pronoun chū .
The root alone is often used as an Imperative ; thus , an , look ; thēng , go ; si-si , put .
A is sometimes prefixed ; thus , a-bāk , eat ; a-hū , bind .
A suffix o , perhaps identical with the vocative suffix , is added in pē-yo , give ; nūngāi-ya woi-yo , happy let-us-be , etc.
Tik in wā-tik , come , seems to be identical with the future suffix .
The root alone is also used as an Infinitive or Verbal noun ; thus , na-sa-nāū chang ka-ma-tik-ni-yo , thy son to be I-worthy-not ; ka-ni nūngāi hāraū chūm-so , we to-be-merry to-be-glad has-become-proper .
A suffix a or ā is added in hūng-sū-wā lām-a , drumbeating ( and ) dancing .
The form ending in yaū is treated as a verbal noun of the past or completed action .
The verbal nouns are treated as ordinary nouns , and may be combined with postpositions , etc., in order to form adverbial clauses .
The suffix of the Infinitive of purpose is ang ; compare Future .
The Relative participles have been mentioned in connection with Relative pronouns .
The suffix pā is also used to form a noun of agency ; thus , yāo-sēl-bā , sheep-tender , shepherd ; laū-ē-bā , cultivator .
The verbal noun with the suffix ā is used as an Adverbial and a Conjunctive participle .
The latter form seems to be the past tense , perhaps used as a relative participle .
There is no Passive voice .
Compound verbs are freely formed in order to modify the meaning of the principal verb .
Both verbs are sometimes inflected .
In most cases , however , only one suffix is added .
The verb pi , to give , forms Causatives .
Other words added in order to form compound verbs are hū , together ; lāk , begin ; sēr , back , again .
Compare , however , the suffix of the past tense .
The Negative particle is ni ; thus , ngāi-ni-yo , he wished-not .
It is used as a verb in lāimā ni-yaū-wē , a-little is-not , it is not sufficient .
Ni seems always to be followed by the suffix yaū or yo , and the forms no , nok , and nong , are used when this suffix is wanting .
They seem to contain a negative prefix n , which is identical with ni , and a verb substantive o , ok , or ong .
Compare Introduction , p .19 , and the Tibetan affirmative suffix o.
The usual order of words is subject , direct object , indirect object , verb .
Lahndā cannot be called the language of the District of Pesn|awar , any more than it can be called the language of Kohat .
The population of Peshawar in 1901 was 788 , 707 , of whom 619,025 spoke that language .
There is no territorial division between the two languages .
Here , not only are Paṣh.tōand Hindkō spoken , but also Hindōstānī , Pañjābī and other languages of various parts of India .
Here the mixture of languages is so great that some , not without reason , describe this form of Hindkō , locally known as Peshāwarī , as a mongrel product of city life .
The first is a version of the Parable of the Prodigal Son in the language of the district , and the second is a ghazal , or ode , in the language of the city .
As the latter is a literary production it appears , not only in the Roman character , but also in the Persian character , as received from the local authorities .
The language of both specimens is nearly the same as North-Western Lahndā of the Jhelum Dhan and of Hazara .
Thus vich is used as a preposition , not as a postposition , and we have gham mah.shar-dē-nēfor mah.shar-dēgham-nē , an order of words entirely un-Indian , and due to the memory of the Persian gham-ӗ-mah.shaṛThe influence of Pañjābī and Hindōstānī is very strong .
The Agent case is formed by adding nē , and not as in the standard by a special declensional form .
The postposition of the Ablative is the Hindōstānī sē ( sab-sē , sālā~-sē , kahṇē-sē , mukh-sē ) .
In verbs , the infinitive ends in ṇā or nā , as in Pañjābī ( not in un .
) , its oblique form ending in ṇē ( nē ) ( not in an .) 
In the latter example , note that āwāz is treated as masculine , not as feminine .
Several Hindōstānī verbs are used , such as jāṇā instead of vañun , to go ; kahṇā , not ākhun , to say ; dauṛnā , not bhajjuṇ , to run .
The letter d is not cerebralized as in Thaḷī .
In the declension of nouns the word for ‘ father ’ is piū , which remains unchanged for all cases of the singular and the nominative plural .
The following pronominal forms occur : mä~ , I ; manē , case of agent ; manū~ , or mänū~ ( Specimen II ) , to me ; mērā , my .
Other pronouns are as in Standard Lahndā .
The Present of the verb substantive is conjugated as follows .
It will be seen that it differs from the Standard in the third person plural .
The forms beginning with w , wā~ , wē~ , wä~ , wē , wä , seem to be used only after vowels , as in mārnā-wā~ , I am striking ; charāndā-wa : ( sentence 229 ) , he is grazing ; lammā-wä , he is tall ( sentence 231 ) .
The Past tense is quite different from the Standard .
There is a negative verb substantive nayyā~ , I am not , equivalent to the Standard nimhū~ .
The verb ‘ to become ’ is hōṇā , not thīṇā .
In the active verb , the infinitive , as previously stated , ends in ṇā or nā , not un .
The chief departures from the Standard are , however , in the future and present definite tenses .
The future is thus conjugated : 
It will be observed that transitive verbs do not insert ē as in the Standard .
In puchhsiā , he will question thee ( Specimen II ) , the suffix of the accusative of the 2nd person singular appears to be ā .
If this is correct , we may compare the corresponding suffix ā of Shiṇā , one of the Dardic languages , spoken in the country round Gilgit .
For the Present Definite we have : Similarly marnā-ā~ , I am dying , karnā-wā~ , I am doing .
There are probably contracted forms in the plural , as in the singular , but I have not come across them .
It will be observed that both the North-Eastern ( mārnā ) and the North-Western ( mārdā ) forms of the present participle are employed .
The Perfect contracts its forms as in the present .
For irregular past participles we may note : piā , not pēā , fallen .
According to Mr.Diack , ‘ the glen is a very deep and narrow one , extending from the mountain ridge ( at that point impassable or nearly so ) forming the tri-junction of the Bias , Chenab , and Spiti watersheds down to the valley of the Parbati , a large tributary of the Bias / from the east .
I am indebted to Mr.G .C .L .Howell , Assistant Commissioner of Kulu , for two specimens and a list of Standard Words and Phrases in Kanāshī .
Mr.Howell writes that he has not as yet been able to make a thorough study of Kanāshī , and that several points in pronunciation and grammar still remain uncertain .
The materials have been noted down in Roman and vernacular characters .
Mr.Howell states that he cannot hear any aspirates in the dialect , but that his clerks say they can .
The state of things is probably the same as in Tibetan , where unaspirated mutes are much less aspirated than in English , and the corresponding aspirates more like the English unaspirated sounds .
I have therefore introduced aspirates where the Tibetan text gives them .
Cerebral letters have likewise been introduced from the texts in Tibetan character .
The same is the case with the palatal ny , for which the Romanized text has n .The dialect possesses semi-consonants in words such as tek ’ , great ; buratak ’ , comes ; duj ’ , to him , and so on .
Thus the suffix of the dative occurs as uj , uzh , and uz .
Tones are said to be a prominent feature of the dialect .
The accent is usually thrown as far back as possible .
There are no articles , but i , the shortest form of the first numeral , is often used as a kind of indefinite article ; thus , i maṛshang-ka-di , with a man .
Gender is distinguished in the common way , by using different words or adding terms denoting the sex ; thus , maṛshang , man ; beṭṛī , woman : chho , son ; chīme , daughter ; rāng , horse ; mīch rāng , mare ; kui , dog ; mīch kutī , bitch .
There are two numbers , the singular and the plural .
The latter is not necessarily marked , when it appears from the context ; thus , shum rhad , three bulls .
There is , however , a separate plural suffix ga , which usually takes the fuller form gan before suffixes ; thus , nyish bā-ga , two fathers ; bā-gan-ka , of fathers ; chandi ts o maṛshang-gan-di ts , from good men .
The subject of intransitive verbs is not distinguished by means of any suffix .
The final i in du-i tot-kõ , he was ; duga-i tot-ke , they were , is probably an emphasizing particle .
The subject of transitive verbs is usually distinguished by means of a suffix sh or s ; thus , bā-sh tang-mo , father-by saw , the father saw ; jang-s sanemuk ’ , God-by slew , the God slew .
The two first personal pronouns do not appear to possess any such case .
The suffix of the dative is uj , the final sound of which is stated to be a semiconsonant .
The text in Tibetan character usually has uzh instead ; thus , chime-uj , to a daughter ; chho-uj , to a son ; ba-ga-uj , to fathers ; chime-goj , to daughters .
The suffix of the ablative occurs as s , dz , and ts ; thus , K ultang-s , from Kulu ; korang-ngaz , from the rent ; ba-di- ts , from a father ; chandi ts o maṛshang-gan-di- ts , from good men .
The postposition di ts contains this ts added to di , which seems to mean ‘ with ’ ; compare , bā-di , with , near , the father ; maṛshang-ka-di , to a man , at a man ’ s .
The suffix s is also used to denote the instrument ; thus , bushu-s , with ropes .
The genitive is formed by adding ka ; thus , gramang-ka , of the village ; ba-gan-ka , of fathers .
The suffix of the locative and terminative is a ; thus , pagring-a , in the pagri ; sho-w-a , into the fields ; kaṭhi-gan-a , on the passes .
Other relations are expressed by adding postpositions .
Adjectives .
Adjectives usually precede the noun they qualify ; thus , kora nashing , the lower house ; shobila shobila gāsa , good good clothes ; but mal-ap sab-ap , all the property .
In nyish chandi ts o maṛshang , two good men , an o has been added to the adjective before a plural noun .
way by putting the compared noun in the ablative or the locative ; thus , du-ka bau du-ka ringz ( - ka ) ni ts lamas to , his brother his sister from tall is ; sab-ka-ni ts akli , all from wise ; sab-a tek ’ , all among great .
The initial ni in ni- ts , ni-dz , from , is probably a postposition with the same meaning as di , with ; compare du and nu , that .
Numerals .
The first numerals are given in the list of words .
The forms with ny have been taken from the texts written in the Tibetan character .
Higher numbers are counted in twenties , though the Aryan method of reckoning in tens is also commonly used by men , while the women stick to the other way .
Pronouns .
The following are the personal pronouns : The termination z in ang-z , to me , is identical with the dative suffix uj .
The base nu of the third person is inflected like du .
There are apparently no dual forms and no double forms of the plural of the first person , denoting the exclusive and inclusive plural .
Interrogative pronouns are hate , who ?
Indefinite pronouns are formed from the same bases ; thus , hati , any one ; hasi , by any one ; chhigi , anything .
The pronoun of the third person is also used as a demonstrative pronoun .
Relative pronouns are yang-s , by whom ; yang , whatever .
Verbs .
The materials at my disposal are not sufficient for giving a full sketch of Kanāshī conjugation .
There are no certain instances of the use of suffixes to denote an object or to add a reflexive meaning .
It is probable that the shi in forms such as ashig , became ; lam-shig , was found ; na-shi-tamung , we sit , is an intransitive or passive suffix , but nothing can be said with certainty .
As in Kanāwᵃrī there are two verbs meaning ‘ to give , ’ ran .
There is at least a strong tendency to distinguish the person of the subject by adding suffixes to the verb ; thus , boke-k , I went ; boke-n , wentest ; bok , he went .
In the first person singular a k is added ; thus , shigu-ta-k , I die .
This k is a semiconsonant , and g is occasionally written instead ; thus , shaṇ-mo-g , I did .
Forms such as to-tang , I should beat ; sho-tang , ( that I ) might make ( merry ) , are perhaps plural , and to-tan , I may beat , is perhaps misheard for to-tang .
In the second person singular a suffix n is usually added ; thus , to-n , art ; bo-ke-n , wentest .
In tot-ke-n-õ , wast , a nasalized vowel has been added .
There is apparently no suffix to denote a subject of the third person ; thus , to , is ; royo-to , lives ; lon-mo , said .
Often , however , a half pronounced k ’ is added , as in the case of the first person ; thus , bura-tak ’ , he comes .
The characteristic termination of the two first persons plural is apparently ng ; thus , bong-ta-ng , we go ; bo-ke-ng , we went .
Verb Substantive .
The usual base of the verb substantive is to or tot , and it is inflected as follows .
192 , gu toz tod-ke-k , I was beating , shows that tot-ke-k is the past .
Forms such as tosh are also used as a respectful singular ; compare Kanāwᵃrī .
Finite verb .
The verb substantive seems to play a considerable rôle in the conjugation of finite verbs , many forms being compounds of a participle and a verb substantive .
There are apparently two tenses , a present-future and a past .
Mr.Howell doubts that the present and future terminations are interchangeable , but states that he has not been able to make his Mālānīs understand the difference between the various tenses , and the remarks which follow are therefore given with some reserve .
Present time .
The usual suffix of the present , which is also used as a future , is apparently ta , added to the base or to a form ending in u , ku , or gu ; thus , bong-ta-k , I go , I shall go ; shigu-ta-k , I die ; royo-ta-n , dwellest ; raṇ-ta-n , givest ; dwa-ta , he comes ; bura-tak ’ , he comes ; sho-tak , he does ; to-ta-ng , we strike , we shall strike ; tugu-tang , we drink ; bung-tang and buko-tang , you go , etc.
Some suffixes such as mung , kung , kun , kon , or kũ , and kush , are often added to this ta , apparently without adding anything to the meaning ; thus , nashi-ta-mung , we sit ; to-ta-kung , you beat , they beat ; to-ta-kun ( or - kũ ) , you will beat , he will beat ; togu-ta-kũ , beatest , beats ; lam-she-ta-kush , we pitch ; to-ta-kush , they will beat , etc.
The same is probably also the case with tashang , is .
Periphrastic forms containing the verb substantive are royo-to , he lives ; raku-ta-to , he is grazing , and probably also bura-ch-to , he will come .
A k suffix occurs in na-shi-k , sits ; hashi-g-eg , is ; sukh-ne-k ’ , there is peace ; bo-ke , they go ; raṇ-kek ’ , they give , etc.
Such forms are commonly used as past tenses .
Past time .
The usual suffixes of past time are apparently me or mo and k , ke , or ge ; thus , shaṇ-mo-g , I did ; to-me-k , I struck ; bura-ke-k , I have come ; to-me-ng , we struck ; bo-ke-ng , we went ; khang-me-n , boughtest ; bo-ke-n , wentest ; bo-k , went ; wat-k , laughed ; mil-ek , was found ; bura-k , came ; richi-mo , he asked ; raṇ-muk ’ , he gave ; shaṇ-mug , he did ; ts ha-mek , he heard ; bo-ke , they went ; bhur-muk , they left .
The suffixes kun or kũ and kush are used as in the present time .
Forms such as hashig and hashik , became ; achig , arose , have already been mentioned under the head of present time .
Imperative .
The base alone can be used as an imperative ; thus , raṇ , give ; ach , be .
The final ng in forms such as pi-chi-ng , put ; ka-ng , bring , is perhaps a plural suffix .
Compare the final ng in verbal forms of the first and second persons plural .
There are apparently some imperative suffixes such as ke , t , and u ; compare ts hud-ke , bind ; bung-t , go ; ra-ṭ , give ; lā-u , put ; to-muk , beat .
Note also pi-chi-gu-n , make me , which apparently contains a suffix gu denoting an object of the first person , and another suffix n denoting the subject .
Passive voice .
There does not appear to be any passive voice .
Verbal nouns and participles .
The usual verbal nouns are formed by adding the suffix m or miz ; thus , yang-m , to live ; la-miz , to wear .
Forms such as hashi-ta , to be ; boda , to spare , are apparently identical with the usual base of the present time .
The reduplicated base is used as a participle ; thus , za-za , eating ; to-to , beaten .
The usual tense bases are probably also used as participles .
Negative voice .
The negative particle is a prefixed ma ; thus , ma-raṇ , did not give ; ma-yag , did not wish .
The vowel of ma seems to be rather faint , and has a tendency to approach the initial vowel of the verb in sound ; compare me ken-ken , didst not give ; mu tutash , does not come .
The order of words is said to be comparatively free .
The usual succession , however , is subject , object , verb .
The 1901 Census figures for the dialect are as follows .
The Mãgar dialect is relatively well known .
A version of the Parable of the Prodigal Son and a list of Standard Words and Phrases have been kindly prepared for the purposes of this Survey by the Nepal Darbar , and they will be printed below .
Beames , J ., Outlines of Indian Philology , with a map shewing the distribution of Indian Languages .
Appendix A contains numerals , and Appendix B personal pronouns in Magar .
Hunter , W.W., A Comparative Dictionary of the Languages of India and High Asia .
Beames , John , On the Magar Language of Nepal .
Campbell , Sir George , Specimens of Languages of India .
The remarks on Mãgarī grammar which follow are based on the materials printed below and on Mr.Beames ’ sketch , which should be consulted for further details .
Mãgarī has been much influenced by Aryan dialects , especially in vocabulary .
Some of the most usual case-suffixes are likewise Aryan .
On the whole , however , the general character of the dialect has remained unchanged .
Pronunciatioṇ Mãgarī possesses the vowels a , e , i , o , and u .
The vowels are sometimes marked as long and sometimes as short .
Really long vowels are , however , said to exist only in borrowed words .
M , n , r , and l are frequently aspirated , and the same is , according to Mr.Beames , the case with all consonants in excited talk ; thus , ḍhānghonhe , I see , I see , instead of ḍāngone .
Article .
There are no articles , but the numeral kat , one , is used as an indefinite article .
Nouns .
The prefix mi is common in words denoting parts of the body ; thus , ngo mi-talu , my head .
It is probably a demonstrative pronoun .
Another prefix ar occurs in forms such as ar-min , name .
Gender .
The natural gender is distinguished by using different words or by adding qualifying affixes ; thus , bhar-mī , man ; māhazā , woman : thor , bull ; nyet , cow : chü , dog ; chü-mān , or , chu : chhauri , bitch : len-zā mi-zā , son ; māsto mi-zā , daughter : dārhyā mirga , a male deer ; murli mirgā , a female deer .
Number .
The plural is not marked if it appears from the context .
Case .
The subject of intransitive verbs and the object are not distinguished by any suffix .
The dative suffix ke or kī is , however , often used to denote the object ; thus , ho-chu : mi-zā-ko ngo : dāthuk-ā , his son-to me-by struck , I have beaten his son .
The suffix ke , kī , is probably Aryan .
The suffix of the case of the agent , which is used to denote the subject of transitive verbs , is e or i ; thus , bhar-mi-y-e , by a man ; mi-za-i , by the son .
After vowels this suffix is occasionally dropped , or , rather , it is contracted into one sound with the preceding vowel ; thus , bai , by the father .
The suffix of the dative is ki or ke , as has been already remarked .
The suffix of the genitive is o or u ; thus , bay-o , of a father ; des-ũ , of a country .
A preceding vowel is sometimes contracted into one sound with this suffix .
In forms such as bhar-mi-kung , of a man , the final vowel has been accompanied by a nasalization .
The suffix of the locative is āng ; thus , im-āng , in the house .
Other relations are indicated by adding postpositions .
Adjectives .
Adjectives precede the noun they qualify in the nominative .
They very often end in the suffix chü , which is usually written cha or chha , in the specimens ; thus , karang-chü , big .
The particle of comparison is denang ; thus , hochu : bhai hochu : bahini denang ghyān-chu : le , his brother his sister than tall is , his brother is taller than his sister .
Numerals .
The first numerals are given in the list of words .
Numerals precede the word they qualify .
Pronouns .
The following are the personal pronouns : Other forms are kān-kurik , we ; nāng-kurik , you ; nāko and nākun , you , honorific ; nā-kruk , you ( plural ) , and so forth .
Demonstrative pronouns are is and isai , this ; ās and āsai , that .
Hos , he , is also used as a demonstrative pronoun .
Interrogative pronouns are su , who ?
Indefinite pronouns are formed by adding the indefinite particle ra to interrogatives ; thus , su-ye-ra , by any one ; hi-ra , anything .
There are no relative pronouns .
It is , however , combined with the relative participle , and not with the finite tenses of the verb .
Note finally the reflexive pronoun laho , own .
Verbs .
The verb is still in all essential points a noun .
There is no difference for person .
A suffix s is , it is true , often added in the second person ; thus , nāng nung-le and nāng nung-les , thou goest .
Verb substantive .
The usual verb substantive is le or le-sā , past leyā or lā .
A compound form is ā-le , is , which is also used as a future .
Other forms are supplied from the base ts hān , to be , to become , which is borrowed from Naipālī chha ; thus , ngā ts hān-ki hik-le , I can be , I may be .
Finite verb .
The verb substantive is extensively used in the formation of the various tenses of finite verbs .
Present time .
The usual form of the present tense is a compound , the verb substantive being added to the base ; thus , ũ-le , he lives ; dāthuk-le , I strike .
A compound present is formed by adding m-ne or mi-ne , i.e., the verb substantive and the suffix of the conjunctive participle .
Mr.Beames gives mo-ne , or , after consonants , o-ne , instead , and calls this form an aorist because it is used with reference to past , present , or future occurrences .
Mr.Beames also mentions a suffix lang or nang ; thus , nang-ke sāt-nang , I will strike you ; rākh-lang , I bring .
According to the same authority the base is sometimes also used alone as a present ; thus , jai : ki ma jaї , will you eat or not ?
Past time .
Forms such as mhā-le , was lost , are properly forms of the present .
Nung-ne , went , and similar forms , probably also belong to the present time .
The usual suffix of past time , on the other hand , is ā ; thus , zāt-ā , did ; nung-ā , went ; de-y-ā , said , and so forth .
Forms such as ũ-le-sā , lived ; nung-le-sā , went , are apparently also only used with the meaning of a past .
Yā-nhi , gave , is probably another form of the present ya-ne , gives .
A real past is apparently the form ts hān-sī , it became .
Future .
The present is commonly used as a future ; thus , dāthuk-le , I shall beat .
There seems to be , besides a future suffix , ing ; thus , lou kān moja zāt-ing , well we shall make merry .
A future is also formed by prefixing ā and suffixing e ; thus , ā-de-y-e , I shall say ; ā-rākh-e , shall bring .
Imperative .
The suffix of the imperative is o ; thus , rākh-o , bring .
Bases ending in ā change this ā to o or e and insert an h before o , or else a-o becomes o ; thus , yā-ke , to give ; yo-h-o , ye-h-o , and yo , give .
A more polite imperative is formed by adding the suffix ni ; thus , yā-ni , give ; kher-ni , run .
Verbal nouns and participles .
The usual verbal noun is formed by adding the suffix ki or ke ; thus , yā-ke , to give ; zāt-ki , to do .
Forms such as yā-khī , to give , show the common aspiration of the initial consonant .
An infinitive of purpose is formed by adding lai to this form ; thus , was-kī-lai , in order to tend .
Relative participles are formed by adding the suffix chü , which is usually written cha in the specimens ; thus , yā-khī parī-cha ansa , to-give proper-being share , the share which I shall get ; hose dhut .
This form is sometimes also used as a verbal noun ; thus , harkha zāt-cha , to make merry ; ku-chi birin-chu : āle , whom-by sending may be ?
The conjunctive participle is formed by adding mü , or , after consonants , nu : ; thus , yā-mü , having given ; rākh-nü , having brought .
An adverbial participle , which also has the meaning of a conjunctive participle , is formed by adding the suffix nā or nāng ; thus , de-nā , saying ; rā-nāng , on coming .
Passive voice .
There is no passive voice .
Causative verb .
Some causatives are apparently formed by adding k ; thus , rā-ke , to come ; rāk-ke , to bring ; bilāk-nu , causing to put on , from bilh-ke , to put on .
Negative particle .
The negative particle is a prefixed mā ; thus , mā le , I am not ; mā yā , thou didst not give .
Order of words .
The usual order of words is subject , object , verb .
A list of Standard Words and Phrases will be found on p .254 and ff.
This is the language of the Tōrwāls , who occupy the upper portion of the main Swat Valley for about sixty miles from Aryana to Chiroli , and the Chahil Darrah , a valley running to the east from the Swat Valley a little above Chiroli .
The separation of the two portions of the tribe has , however , produced considerable differences in the dialects now spoken .
Those who remained behind in Swat were the ancestors of the present Tōrwālṣ Tōrwālī certainly belongs to the Dardic family , and the mode of formation of the feminine , and some of the verbal forms , show clearly that it is connected with Kāshmīrī .
It is most nearly akin to the language of the Indus Valley which is described by Colonel Biddulph under the name of Gowro .
1 Tribes of the Hindoo Koosh , p .10 , and Appendix F.In order to show the close connexion between the two languages , a column has been added to the List of Standard Words showing the corresponding words in Gowro .
The grammar of the specimens differs considerably from that here given , and is subsequently discussed : 
TŌRWĀLĪ GRAMMAR ( BIDDULPH ) .
Other vowels and consonants as usual in other Indian languages .
NOUNS .
There are two declensions relating to ( I ) animate and ( II ) inanimate nouns B .
Active Verb , kudūsa , to strike .
Except the Imperative each tense has only two forms , A Masculine and a Feminine , and does not change for number or person .
Thus , The Conditional mood is formed by adding kyăh , perhaps , to the Indicative .
The Passive voice is formed by the use of the Auxiliary verb bajūsa , to go .
The following incomplete account of Tōrwālī Grammar is based on the specimens .
NOUNS , Declension .
The only instances I have met in which the plural differs from the singular , are gāō , a cow ; plural gai , and the following naukar , means ‘ servants , ’ but naukar-ā-mē~ , among servants ; naukar-ā-kī , to the servants : dehqān , villagers ; dehqān-a , to the villagers ; dehqānō , the villagers ( Agent case ) : yār-ō-sat , with friends .
The Agent case is usually the same as the nominative ; thus , bap banū , by the father it was said , the father said .
As a matter of fact the Nominative is frequently used instead of the Agent .
Instances of the Vocative case are , ai babia , O father , and ai pūchha , O son .
Adjectives Do not seem to change for gender .
PRONOUNS First Person , I , ā , ai ; of me , my , mī ; Agent and Obl .
mai ; we , mō ; Agent , mō ; of us , our , mun ; to us , mō-gē .
Second Person , Thou , tū ; of thee , thy , chhī or ( Parable ) chhē ; Agent , tai ; ye , thō ; of you , you , tun ; Agent , thō ; to you , tha-kai .
Third Person , He , sēh , ēh ; Agent , sēh , ēh ; of him , his , isa , ( Parable ) isē ; Obl .
and Agent ) tiyā ; of them , their , tiyāsa .
He , tēh , tis ; Agent , tēh , tis ; Obl .
Examples of Pronominal Adjectives are , Sēh māsh , that man ; Tē watan yat , on that country ; āh pūchh , this son ; as ghō-chē , of this horse ; as shai , that thing .
VERBS A .Auxiliary Verbs and Verbs Substantive .
Present , Sing .
( all persons ) , thū ; Plur .
In kā ehhal chhī , what matter is it ?, chhī is possibly feminine .
Past , Sing .
In the phrases tang shū , he became straitened ; and ṭagō shū , she was fastened , the shū is probably borrowed from Paṣh.tō.
Of the base hu , we have the following examples : naukar hū ( and elsewhere ) , he became a servant ; jandī hū-thū , he has become alive ; āi chhē .
Active Verb .
Imperative , beat , kūṭh .
Present , I am beating , etc., Sing .
( all persons ) , kūṭha-thū ; plur .
So also , bazha-thū , I go ; plural also bazha-thū ; chā-thū , he is grazing ; bhaiṭ-thū , he is sitting , he dwells ; yai-thū , he comes .
In the Parable we have tū bhai-thū , thou art living ; mū , I die , is apparently a Simple Present .
Past .
Transitive verbs .
These are construed passively in the Past Tenses , and the subject is put in the case of the Agent .
Sometimes the Nominative is used instead of the Agent , as in ā kūṭhū-shū or mai kūṭhū-shū ( Pluperfect ) , I had beaten .
I beat ( Past ) , mai kūṭhūā .
So for all persoṇs and both numbers , the pronoun being usually in the case of the Agent .
Intransitive Verbs .
These are construed actively ; ā gā , I went , and so on for all persons and both numbers .
Future , ā kūṭhīyā , I shall beat .
Does not change for person or number .
Habitual Past , dēwūdat , ( no one ) used to give ; khātai , ( they ) used to eat ; yawūdo , ( the she-jackal ) used to come ; khawūdō , ( she ) used to eat .
Examples of the Passive are , mai kūṭhū-thū , I am beaten ; mai kūṭhū-shū , I was beaten ; mai kūṭhīngā , I .shall be beaten .
This dialect is spoken in the Kōhistān on both banks of the Indus , between that river and the Swat valley on the one side , and on the other between it and the watershed of the Jhelam and its affluents .
Maiyā~ has several dialects .
Another is spoken round Kōlī and Pālus , in Jalkōṭ , Batērā , Marēn , Gobērā and Chilīṣ It is practically the dialect of the west side of the Kōhistān here .
It is the dialect of the east side of the Kōhistāṇ The people are chiefly Shāh Khēlṣ A fourth dialect is spoken more to the south , and is that illustrated below .
In order to show the close connexion with Chilīs , another column has been added īn the list of Standard Words showing the corresponding words in that language .
2 Tribes of the Hindoo Koosh , p .10 , and Appendix C .The following grammatical sketch of Maiyā~ is based on the specimens and on the List of Standard Words : I .NOUNS .
There seem to be two declensions .
In the first , the noun does not change either for case or for number .
The postpositions , denoting case , being simply added to the nominative .
Similarly appear to be declined māsh , a man ; ghō , a horse ; gō , a bull ; gharī~ , a woman ; and jawāb , an answer .
In the second declension , the letter a seems to be used to form the plural .
Similarly appear to be declined puṭh , a son ; naukar , a servant ; ghōī , a mạre ; kāsar , a dog ; and kūsīr , a bitch .
The nomïnative plural of gā , a cow , is gāī .
Some nouns appear to take thïs a also in the oblique cases of the singular .
So far as appears from the specimens , the Accusative and Agent cases are the same as the Nominative .
Adjectives do not appear to change for Gender or Number .
PRONOUNS .
Other cases are formed by adding postpositions to the Genitive .
The Agent case is used as the subject before transitive verbs in the past tenses .
Curiously enough , as appears from the list of Standard Words , the Agent , and not the Nominative , is used in the second person singular , and in the third person singular and plural of the Future .
Even before the past tenses , the use of the Agent is not always adhered to .
In spīte of these exceptional instances , the specimens show clearly that the Agent case is properly used before the past tenses of Transitive verbs .
Other pronominal forms occurring in the specimens are tas , him ; tas-na , from him ; ȭ or as , this , both substantive and adjective ; asā~ , of this , and so on .
III .– VERBS .
A .Auxiliary Verbs and Verbs Substantive .
Present .
This is thū , for all the persons and both numbers .
It is also frequently used instead of ā~s , in the sense of the past .
Past .
Besides thū , we have also ā~s , plural ā~sū , for all persons .
hōn-shat , I shall be ; bā-shat , literally , I shall go , is also used in the same sense .
Active Verb .
The standard verb , of which paradigms will be given , is kuṭȭ , to beat .
Present Participle , kuṭa , beating .
Past Participle , kuṭagalai , having beaten ; so karai , having made , in which gal is omitted .
Other examples of the Present Participle are hōē , being ; and bai , going .
Imperative , kuṭagal , beat .
In the following cases , we miss the termination gal : hō , be ; bah , go ; bhai , sit ; ai , come ; ōlihō , stand ; mariyā , die ; dai , see daigal above , give ; nihāla , look .
The following are first persons plural , khaglai , let us eat ; and hūgai , let us become .
Simple Present , kuṭānt , I beat , etc., for all persons and both numbers .
The plural may apparently add an a , for we have khānta , they eat .
In the Parable , this is used as a Past , in bhākun nī baita , he went not inside .
Here , the singular also ends in a .
Marīā is translated ‘ I die , ’ but perhaps it is a Past Participle , and means ‘ I am dead ’ .
Definite Present , Only two examples , both of the same verb , are fortheoming .
Future , kuṭagal-ashat , I shall beat , for all persons and both numbers .
The syllable gal may apparently be dropped , for we have ba-shat or ba shata , I will go ; mana-shat , I will say .
In the former , we see an a added , as in the present .
is translated , ‘ I will arise , ’ but the word is a Past , and probably here means , ‘ having arisen ’ .
See what has been said above , under the head of Pronouns , regarding the form taken by a pronoun which is the subject of a verb in this tense .
Past , This differs in the case of transitive and in the case of intransitive verbs .
Transitive Verbs , kuṭagil , I beat , for all persons and both numbers .
In kaī~ nī dit , no one gave , dit is properly a present .
In none of the above-quoted instances has the form of the verb changed owing to the object being feminine .
The subject , when a pronoun , is usually in the Agent case .
See above , under the head of Pronouns .
In the case of Substantives , the Agent has the same form as the Nominative .
Intransitive Verbs , baīgā , I went , etc.
; plural , baigil , both unchanged for person .
The words marial , he died ; and lābayā , he was lost , do not belong to this group , and may be Past Participles .
Other instances of Transitive Verbs are , ghina-thū , thou hast bought ; kara-thū , he has , or I have , made ; chāla-thū , he has found ; dai-thū , thou hast given .
Instances of Intransitive Verbs are , ho-thū , he has become ; tēl-thū , I have walked ; ī-thū , he has come .
Passive , kuṭais-thū , I am or was beaten .
The Past is formed by adding the syllable ūz in the words chālūzīgā , he is recovered ; ghȭ khar .
The usual plural suffix is ku , thus , marrī , son ; marku , sons ; pal-ku , teeth .
I have not found any instances of the use of the suffixes ōr and ṅg , but there is no reason for supposing that they are wanting .
The accusative ends in n and the dative in ke or ku , but the two cases are continually confounded .
Other cases are formed as in Gōṇḍī .
Numerals .
The first ten numerals are , Āru , six ; yēḍu , seven ; yemmidi , eight ; tommidi , nine , and pad , ten , are the usual forms in Telugu , and are probably borrowed from that language .
Pronouns .
The personal pronouns are the same as in the Gōṇḍī dialect of Bastar .
The corresponding forms of the second person are miraḍ , you ; mīvā , your .
Other pronouns are vēr , this , neuter id ; bōr , who ?
Verbs .
The personal terminations are .
Dātān , I will go ; kettitān , I will say , are forms of the present , and mendēbān , I might be , is half Oṛiyā .
The negative verb is regular .
The conjunctive participle is regularly formed .
But no authority gives a description of the tribe or an account of the language .
The remarks on Aimol grammar which follow are , therefore , entirely based on the texts printed below .
The second specimen , an Aimol folk-tale , gives a very good idea of the language .
In all essential points of grammar the dialect is closely related to Rāngkhōl and connected languages .
The marking of long vowels is not consistent and apparently not always correct .
In other cases we find the same vowel sometimes marked as long , and sometimes as short .
Thus , ka and kā , my ; kārā and kāra , among ; a-tār and a-tar , old ; ngāi and ngai , many , used as a plural suffix ; māi-kūng-am and ma-ton , before , etc.
The vowels of prefixes are sometimes dropped .
Some vowels are interchangeable .
Thus , the intensifying suffix ko is also written kū and kē ; the indefinite particle om also occurs as ūm .
Concurring vowels are often contracted .
Thus , a-mā-in and a-mān , he ; chēng-ka-ta , i.e., chē-ing-ka-ta , going ; a-ta , saying ; from ti , to say , plus the suffix ā , etc.
Final consonants are usually softened when a vowel is added .
Final consonants are sometimes silent .
Most of the prefixes and suffixes which occur in Aimol have a distinct meaning of their own and will be dealt with below .
Only a few prefixes 
There are no articles .
The numeral khat or an-khat , one , is used as an indefinite article , and pronominal prefixes , demonstrative pronouns , and relative clauses are used in order to convey the idea of definiteness .
The prefixes a and ka , which often occur before nouns denoting relationship and parts of the body , are the possessive pronouns of the third and first persons .
Gender is only apparent in the case of animate nouns .
It is distinguished by means of suffixes , and , in the case of human beings , also by using different words .
Pasal is also used as a male suffix ; thus , nāi pasal , child male , son .
The usual suffixes are , in the case of human beings , pā and nū , and , in the case of animals , a-chal and chal , male , and a-pūi , female .
There are two numbers , the singular and the plural .
When it is necessary to mark the plural some word conveying the idea of plurality is added ; thus , swok ngāi , servant many , servants ; a-tar-ngai , old creatures ; sē-kor a-chal tam , horse male many , horses ; lū-fāi a-tam , rupee many , these rupees .
The Nominative and the Accusative do not take any suffix .
Ko is often added in order to emphasise the noun .
The suffix in , by , by means of , denoting the agent , is usually added to the subject of a transitive verb .
The Genitive is often expressed by simply putting the governed before the governing noun .
The governed noun is often repeated by means of a possessive pronoun prefixed to the governing noun .
The Vocative does not require any suffix , but an ē is sometimes prefixed ; thus , ē-pā , O father .
Adjectives are usually preceded by the prefix a ; thus , a-sā , good ; a-sāng-a , high .
A prefix ma occurs in ma-tūm-pā , younger .
The suffix pā in this and in other adjectives is a suffix of the relative participle .
The usual verbal suffixes are added when the adjectives have the function of a verb ; thus , a-sāng-yoi , he is tall .
Some adjectives have , according to the list of words , two forms according to the number of the qualified noun .
Adjectives usually follow , but occasionally also precede the noun they qualify .
The particles of comparison are nēg-ā and kārā ; thus , a-char-nū nēg-ā a-nāi-pang-pā a-sāng-yoi , his-sister than his-brother he-tall-is ; an-d-rēng-ā kāra a-sāng-a , all 
A kind of superlative is also effected by adding cak ; thus , pūwon a-sā-tak , cloth good-much , the best cloth .
The numerals are given in the list of words .
They follow the noun they qualify .
An in the first three numerals is probably a generic prefix , but I fail to see the rule for its use .
There are no traces in the specimens of other generic prefixes .
In a-mā man-ko lū-fāi an-ni makhāi man-kē , that-of the-price rupees two and-a-half , the last man-kē seems to be a repetition of the subject man , price , and is not a generic suffix .
The following are the Personal pronouns : Singular , Plural , A form nai , thou , seems to occur in kai yēng-a lal nai na-pēk-rang , me to property thou thou-give-wilt ; and tū yēng-ā nai-chok-mo , whom from thou-boughtest ?
The personal pronouns are inflected as nouns .
Ni in kai-ka-ni , mine ; nang-na-ni , thine , must be considered as the verb substantive .
In nang-a-rang-kē , thine , an a is inserted between nang and the postposition rang , for .
Words such as ko , kē , hi , etc., are added in order to emphasise the pronouns .
They are all originally demonstrative pronouns .
Demonstrative pronouns .
Han-ko in pasal han-ko fai-loi-yā a-man-chē , man that field-to he-sent , seems to contain ha , the suffix of the agent , and the emphasising particle ko .
There are no relative pronouns .
A relative participle is formed by adding the suffix ā .
The ordinary tenses of the verb can be used in the same way .
In the last instance the relative participle follows the qualified noun .
Pā seems to form relative participles or nouns of agency .
Interrogative pronounṣ Tū-mo , who ?
Oho-mo seems , therefore , to mean ‘ where ?’ An indefinite pronoun is effected by adding ūm to the pronoun tū ; thus , tūn-ūm pē-makū , any one gave not .
Verbs are conjugated in person and number by means of pronominal prefixes .
The singular prefixes sometimes occur with a verb in the plural .
239 an is used in the singular .
ani seems to be a demonstrative pronoun , and the literal translation is apparently ‘ what that-done ?’ The plural prefix is used when the subject comprises two words connected by means of lē , with .
The prefixes are sometimes omitted .
In a-hoyān chāg-ā , they happily eating-are , the prefix an before chāg-ā seems to have been contracted with the ā of the preceding a-hoy-ā .
The root alone , without any suffix , is freely used to denote present and past times .
A suffix ā , which generally forms adverbial clauses and conjunctive participles , is sometimes added , apparently without changing the meaning .
So and sē are apparently assertive suffixes in sentences such as i-mo ani-tho-so , what are they doing ?
The suffix lāi has a similar function ; see Negative particle , below .
The suffix of the Past tenses is yoi as in Chiru .
It is also used to denote the present time when the action of the verb is considered as an established fact .
A-ni-yoi , it is , it was , is sometimes added to a verb in order to emphasise that the action really takes place .
A suffix pē is apparently added in forms such as a-yū-pē , he kissed ; a-deng-pē , it fell ; a-lūt-pē , he entered , etc.
But these forms are really compound verbs , the latter part being a verb pē , probably identical with pē , to give .
Compare a-pēr-a-pē , he bit , where the pronominal prefix is added to both verbs .
A Present definite is formed by prefixing la , or by adding the verb om , to be , to remain .
The suffix of the Future is ing , probably a postposition meaning ‘ for , ’ ‘ in order to ’ .
The pronominal prefixes are wanting before this form ; thus , lai choi-noning , fine pay-not-will , I will not pay fine .
The verb ti , probably meaning ‘ to say , ’ preceded by the pronominal prefixes , is usually added .
Another suffix of the future is rang .
The form chang-lang-rong , in na-swok khat chang-lang-rong , thy-servant one ( I ) be-will , seems to be connected with the imperative .
I-sig-ā-mo-ka-tin-ko , because , perhaps contains a future ka-tin .
The suffix of the Imperative is ro , and in the first person plural rai .
Ta is prefixed to ro in na-pēk-ta-ro , give ; bēng-ta-ro , put , etc.
The root alone , without any suffix , is used as an Infinitive or Verbal noun .
The past tense ending in yoi is used as a past verbal noun .
Postpositions are freely added to these verbal nouns in order to form adverbial clauses .
A suffix na seems to occur in a-hong-na-khan-a-ko , his-coming-time-at-just , as soon as he came .
The suffix of the Infinitive of purpose is rang , the same postposition which is also used in order to form the future .
The Relative participles have been mentioned with Relative pronouns .
The noun of agency is , as stated in the same place , formed by the suffix pā .
Laū-chon-mi-kēng , a cultivator , contains the same word kēng , and is formed by prefixing the relative participle without any suffix to mi , a man .
The suffix ā , mentioned with verbal nouns , forms Adverbial and Conjunctive participles .
The suffix lā forms a conjunctive participle which is substituted for the first of two co-ordinate imperatives .
In is prefixed to this lā if the imperative is of the first person plural , and ūn if it is of the second person plural .
In a-mā-ha-ko vē-jag-in-lā rūi-yā khit-ro , him beaten-having ropes-with bind , in-lā is the suffix in the second person singular .
There is no Passive voice .
The suffix of the agent is usually added to the subject of an active transitive verb .
The first of these sentences must be translated as a passive , the second as an active .
Compound verbs are freely formed in order to modify the meaning of the primary verb .
The prefixes ma and man form causatives .
En seems to have been prefixed to tho in kan-tho-in-ka-ta , probably for ka-en-tho-ing-ka-ta , I-arising .
Hong , to come , is used as a prefix in order to denote 
Desideratives are formed by adding nwom , to wish ; thus , lūt-nwom-lāi-mā , ( he ) to-enter-wished-not .
Intensives seem to be formed by reduplicating the root ; thus , a-yong-yong-ā , he-coming-coming , running .
Other words added in order to form compounds are don , to begin ; jag , well ; kir , back ; sū , entirely , etc.
The Negative particle is mak , ma , or mā .
It is probably a verb substantive .
Another negative is noni , corresponding to Rāngkhōl noni ; thus , lai choi-noning , fine ( I ) pay-not-will .
The Interrogative particle is mo .
It is generally a part of the interrogative pronoun , but is sometimes also added to the verb .
It is added to the verb when there is no interrogative pronoun ; thus , a-sūong-yoi-mo , has it been cooked ?
The usual order of words is subject , object , verb .
Before dealing with that form of speech it will be necessary to give a short account of some minor dialects of Berar and the Central Provinces which occupy a position like that of Gōṇḍī between Kanarese-Tamil and Telugu .
The points in which they differ from that language are , however , of sufficient importance to make it necessary to separate them from that form of speech .
The number of speakers has been estimated for the purposes of this Survey as followš – A few speakers are probably also found in Pusad , in the Basim district .
The Kōlāmī dialect differs widely from the language of the neighbouring Gōṇḍṣ In some points it agrees with Telugu , in other characteristics with Kanarese and connected forms of speech .
There are also some interesting points of analogy with the Toda dialect of the Nilgiris , and the Kōlāms must , from a philological point of view , be considered as the remnants of an old Dravidian tribe who have not been involved in the development of the principal Dravidian languages , or of a tribe who have not originally spoken a Dravidian form of speech .
Haig , Captain Wolseley , A Comparative Vocabulary of the Gōṇḍi and Kōlāmī Languages .
The notes on Kōlāmī grammar which follow are based on the version of the Parable of the Prodigal Son printed below .
Nouns .
The usual suffix of the plural is l ; thus , paisā-l , money ; gēṭṭā-l , feet ; kēv-ul , ears ; ture-l , swine .
In bālā-kōl , sons , the suffix kōl corresponds to Tamil and Kanarese gaḷ , Tulu kuḷu .
In māsur-uṅg , to the men , we apparently have a plural suffix ur , r .There are no instances in the texts of a feminine noun .
The feminine and neuter singular take the same form in Naikī , and this is probably also the case in Kōlāmī .
The dative has the same form as the accusative , the suffix being n or ṅg ; thus , bālān , the son ; mākkun , to the neck ; māsuruṅg , to the servants .
The genitive is formed by adding n , ne , or net , and the locative by adding t.Thus , anne kākōkne bālā , the son of my uncle ; telmī gurrāmnet khōgir , the saddle of the white horse ; annet ambān māsuruṅg , to the servants of my father ; kīt , on the hand ; vegāṭ , in the field ( vegād , field ) .

Pronouns .
The following are the Personal pronouns : The plural forms are apparently seldom used , the singular forms being used instead .
Verbs .
Plural forms are sometimes used in the singular , and vice versâ .
The Verb substantive forms its present tense as follows .
There are no instances of real plural forms in the materials available .
The corresponding past tense is : 
Finite verbs are similarly .
inflected .
The present tense is also used as a future , and the characteristic consonant of the past tense is d , t.Thus , kākātūn , I shall make ; kāktān , I did ; sedden , he went .
There are very few instances of the third person neuter .
The imperative takes no suffix , but r is added in the plural .
The negative verb is formed by adding tōten , to the base .
In other cases the negative verb is formed by adding an e to the base , and using the ordinary personal and tense suffixes .
The base seems to be used as a verbal noun .
Another verbal noun ends in ād and contains the neuter demonstrative pronoun .
The Dhīmāl dialect is spoken by a small tribe in the Darjeeling Terai .
No estimates of the number of speakers have been forwarded for the purposes of this Survey .
A full vocabulary and a grammatical sketch of the dialect have been published by Hodgson .
The same is the case with the list of Standard Words and Phrases on pp .
Hunter , W.W., A Comparative Dictionary of the Languages of India and High Asia .
The numeral e , one , is used as an indefinite article , and definiteness is indicated by means of demonstrative pronouns .
Gender is indicated by using different words or by prefixing dānkhā , dhāngāi , male ; mahani , bhundi , female , etc.
The plural is not marked when it appears from the context .
The usual plural suffix is gạlai ; thus , chan galai , children .
The subject of intransitive verbs and the object are not distinguished by any suffix .
The subject of transitive verbs is usually put in the case of the agent , which is formed by adding the suffix dong .
The dative , which is sometimes also used as an accusative , is formed by adding ēng .
The suffix of the ablative , which is also often used to denote the agent , is sho ; that of the genitive ko , and that of the locative tā .
Adjectives usually precede , but sometimes also follow the noun they qualify ; thus , ēlkā chan-galai , good children .
The particle of comparison is nhā-dong , which is usually preceded by the compared noun in the genitive .
The first numerals are given in the list of words .
They precede the noun they qualify .
They are often followed by the suffix long , which does not appear to add anything to the meaning ; thus , ē-long dīāng or e-dīāng , one man .
The following are the personal pronouns : The demonstrative pronouns are ī , this ; ū , that .
The demonstrative pronouns are inflected like personal pronouns ; thus , ī-ko , or yāng-ko , of this ; yēng , to this ; yāng-sho , from this .
The plural is ī-bal , these ; ū-bal , those .
Interrogative pronouns are hāshū , who ?
All verbs are inflected in exactly the same way .
If the subject is of the first or second person , the personal pronouns are suffixed to the tense bases .
The usual verb substantive is jeng-li , to be .
The present is jēhi , the past higā-hi , the future jēng , first person kā jēn-kā , I shall be .
The base alone is sometimes used as a present ; thus , nāni mhoikā-dinchā-tā hadē-kā , to-day jungle-to go-I , to-day I am going to the jungle .
The usual present tense is formed by suffixing khi , mhi , or nhi ; thus , kā hadē-khi-kā , I go ; kā dōp-mhi-kā , I speak .
A present definite can be formed by prefixing ēlāng , now , to this tense ; thus , kā ēlāng khāng-khi-kā , I am wishing .
The suffix of the past is hi ; thus , nā hadē-hi-nā , thou wentest .
An imperfect is formed by prefixing lāmpāng , formerly , to the present ; thus , kā lāmpāng khāng-khi-kā , I was wishing .
The suffix of the future is āng , which sometimes becomes ān before the suffix kā of the first person .
The simple base without any suffix is used as an imperative ; thus , chā eat ; mā lē , don ’ t come .
The usual verbal noun is formed by adding li ; thus , hadē-li , to go , in order to go .
Another verbal noun is formed by adding kā ; thus , pā-kā-konāng , on account of doing , because he did .
Such forms are commonly used as relative participles ; thus , dāng-hai-nēn-chā-kā khīā , beating-finding-eating dog , a beaten dog ; dōp-kā kothā , spoken words .
An adverbial participle is formed by adding katāng ; thus , lēn-ka-tāng lēn-ka-tāng hadē-khi , he goes laughing .
A conjunctive participle is formed by adding tēng ; thus , hadē-tēng , having gone .
A kind of passive can however be expressed by adding the verbs nēn , to find , and chā , to eat , to the base and conjugating throughout ; thus , yolla-sho dang-hai nēn-chā-hi-kā , brother-from beating found-ate-I , I was beaten by my brother .
The negative particle is a prefixed mā ; thus , kā mā khāng-khi-kā , I do not wish ; kā mā hān-kā , I am not going ; mā hodē , don ’ t go .
The usual order of words is subject , object , verb .
For further details the student is referred to the works quoted above under the head of authorities and to the list of Standard Words and Phrases on pp .
These forms throw light on Kōlāmī amd , which must be derived from avnd .
Nouns .
The plural suffixes are l .and kul .
The case-suffixes are not always added in the specimen .
Note , however , the occasional use of a dative suffix ku , kūn ; thus , bāpku , to the father ; gaḍyākūn , to the servant .
The numerals are the same as in Kōlāmī .
‘ Five ’ is , however , pā~ch , and ‘ twenty ’ vīṣ The form iddar , two , is also used to denote a feminine plural .
The personal pronouns are .
The forms anned , my ; inned , thy , etc., contain the neuter demonstrative pronoun ad , that .
In Bhīlī we find forms such as innen bālā , thy son , where the possessive pronoun agrees with the qualified noun in the same way as in Gōṇḍī .
Verbs .
The conjugation of verbs presents some points of interest .
The present tense of the verb substantive is formed as follows .
In the third person singular neuter we also find andīn , it is .
The past tense is the same as in Kōlāmī .
The form is , however , perhaps a noun of agency one who is dead .
Finite verbs form their present tense from a participle ending in s , and the past from a form ending in t.The various tenses of the verb gōḷ , to beat , are given as follows .
The s-suffix of the present must be compared with Telugu tsu , tu .
The negative verb is formed from the base without adding any tense-suffixes , or by adding tōdī , not , to the infinitive .
In most of the preceding characteristics and in other important points the Bhīlī of Basim agrees with Kōlāmī , as will be seen from the version of the Parable of the Prodigal Son which follows .
Kanāshī is the dialect spoken in a glen within the Bias valley , containing only the village , called by outsiders Malāna and by the villagers themselves Mālānī .
The village of Malana is thus very isolated , and to this isolation doubtless is due the preservation of the ancient and curious dialect spoken there ’ .
The dialect was not separately returned at the last Census of 1901 .
I am indebted to Mr.G .C .L .Howell , Assistant Commissioner of Kulu , for two specimens and a list of Standard Words and Phrases in Kanāshī .
These materials are far superior to anything that has hitherto been published about the dialect , and the remarks which follow are entirely based on them .
Mr.Howell writes that he has not as yet been able to make a thorough study of Kanāshī , and that several points in pronunciation and grammar still remain uncertain .
Name of the language .
The materials have been noted down in Roman and vernacular characters .
Mr.Howell states that he cannot hear any aspirates in the dialect , but that his clerks say they can .
The state of things is probably the same as in Tibetan , where unaspirated mutes are much less aspirated than in English , and the corresponding aspirates more like the English unaspirated sounds .
The same is the case with the palatal ny , for which the Romanized text has n .The dialect possesses semi-consonants in words such as tek ’ , great ; buratak ’ , comes ; duj ’ , to him , and so on .
Thus the suffix of the dative occurs as uj , uzh , and uz .
Tones and accent .
Tones are said to be a prominent feature of the dialect .
The accent is usually thrown as far back as possible .
Articles .
There are no articles , but i , the shortest form of the first numeral , is often used as a kind of indefinite article ; thus , i maṛshang-ka-di , with a man .
Nouns .
Gender is distinguished in the common way , by using different words or adding terms denoting the sex ; thus , maṛshang , man ; beṭṛī , woman : chho , son ; chīme , daughter ; rāng , horse ; mīch rāng , mare ; kui , dog ; mīch kutī , bitch .
Number .
There are two numbers , the singular and the plural .
The latter is not necessarily marked , when it appears from the context ; thus , shum rhad , three bulls .
There is , however , a separate plural suffix ga , which usually takes the fuller form gan before suffixes ; thus , nyish bā-ga , two fathers ; bā-gan-ka , of fathers ; chandi ts o maṛshang-gan-di ts , from good men .
Case .
The subject of intransitive verbs is not distinguished by means of any suffix .
The final i in du-i tot-kõ , he was ; duga-i tot-ke , they were , is probably an emphasizing particle .
The subject of transitive verbs is usually distinguished by means of a suffix sh or s ; thus , bā-sh tang-mo , father-by saw , the father saw ; jang-s sanemuk ’ , God-by slew , the God slew .
The two first personal pronouns do not appear to possess any such case .
The suffix of the dative is uj , the final sound of which is stated to be a semiconsonant .
The suffix of the ablative occurs as s , dz , and ts ; thus , K ultang-s , from Kulu ; korang-ngaz , from the rent ; ba-di- ts , from a father ; chandi ts o maṛshang-gan-di- ts , from good men .
The postposition di ts contains this ts added to di , which seems to mean ‘ with ’ ; compare , bā-di , with , near , the father ; maṛshang-ka-di , to a man , at a man ’ s .
The suffix s is also used to denote the instrument ; thus , bushu-s , with ropes .
The genitive is formed by adding ka ; thus , gramang-ka , of the village ; ba-gan-ka , of fathers .
The suffix of the locative and terminative is a ; thus , pagring-a , in the pagri ; sho-w-a , into the fields ; kaṭhi-gan-a , on the passes .
Adjectives .
Adjectives usually precede the noun they qualify ; thus , kora nashing , the lower house ; shobila shobila gāsa , good good clothes ; but mal-ap sab-ap , all the property .
In nyish chandi ts o maṛshang , two good men , an o has been added to the adjective before a plural noun .
way by putting the compared noun in the ablative or the locative ; thus , du-ka bau du-ka ringz ( - ka ) ni ts lamas to , his brother his sister from tall is ; sab-ka-ni ts akli , all from wise ; sab-a tek ’ , all among great .
The initial ni in ni- ts , ni-dz , from , is probably a postposition with the same meaning as di , with ; compare du and nu , that .
Numerals .
The first numerals are given in the list of words .
Higher numbers are counted in twenties , though the Aryan method of reckoning in tens is also commonly used by men , while the women stick to the other way .
Pronouns .
The following are the personal pronouns : The termination z in ang-z , to me , is identical with the dative suffix uj .
The base nu of the third person is inflected like du .
There are apparently no dual forms and no double forms of the plural of the first person , denoting the exclusive and inclusive plural .
Interrogative pronouns are hate , who ?
Indefinite pronouns are formed from the same bases ; thus , hati , any one ; hasi , by any one ; chhigi , anything .
The pronoun of the third person is also used as a demonstrative pronoun .
Relative pronouns are yang-s , by whom ; yang , whatever .
Verbs .
The materials at my disposal are not sufficient for giving a full sketch of Kanāshī conjugation .
There are no certain instances of the use of suffixes to denote an object or to add a reflexive meaning .
It is probable that the shi in forms such as ashig , became ; lam-shig , was found ; na-shi-tamung , we sit , is an intransitive or passive suffix , but nothing can be said with certainty .
As in Kanāwᵃrī there are two verbs meaning ‘ to give , ’ ran .
The former is used when the indirect object is of the third person , the latter when it is of the first .
There is at least a strong tendency to distinguish the person of the subject by adding suffixes to the verb ; thus , boke-k , I went ; boke-n , wentest ; bok , he went .
In the first person singular a k is added ; thus , shigu-ta-k , I die .
This k is a semiconsonant , and g is occasionally written instead ; thus , shaṇ-mo-g , I did .
Forms such as to-tang , I should beat ; sho-tang , ( that I ) might make ( merry ) , are perhaps plural , and to-tan , I may beat , is perhaps misheard for to-tang .
In the second person singular a suffix n is usually added ; thus , to-n , art ; bo-ke-n , wentest .
In tot-ke-n-õ , wast , a nasalized vowel has been added .
There is apparently no suffix to denote a subject of the third person ; thus , to , is ; royo-to , lives ; lon-mo , said .
Often , however , a half pronounced k ’ is added , as in the case of the first person ; thus , bura-tak ’ , he comes .
The characteristic termination of the two first persons plural is apparently ng ; thus , bong-ta-ng , we go ; bo-ke-ng , we went .
Verb Substantive .
The usual base of the verb substantive is to or tot , and it is inflected as follows .
Forms such as tosh are also used as a respectful singular ; compare Kanāwᵃrī .
Finite verb .
The verb substantive seems to play a considerable rôle in the conjugation of finite verbs , many forms being compounds of a participle and a verb substantive .
There are apparently two tenses , a present-future and a past .
Mr.Howell doubts that the present and future terminations are interchangeable , but states that he has not been able to make his Mālānīs understand the difference between the various tenses , and the remarks which follow are therefore given with some reserve .
Present time .
The usual suffix of the present , which is also used as a future , is apparently ta , added to the base or to a form ending in u , ku , or gu ; thus , bong-ta-k , I go , I shall go ; shigu-ta-k , I die ; royo-ta-n , dwellest ; raṇ-ta-n , givest ; dwa-ta , he comes ; bura-tak ’ , he comes ; sho-tak , he does ; to-ta-ng , we strike , we shall strike ; tugu-tang , we drink ; bung-tang and buko-tang , you go , etc.
Some suffixes such as mung , kung , kun , kon , or kũ , and kush , are often added to this ta , apparently without adding anything to the meaning ; thus , nashi-ta-mung , we sit ; to-ta-kung , you beat , they beat ; to-ta-kun ( or - kũ ) , you will beat , he will beat ; togu-ta-kũ , beatest , beats ; lam-she-ta-kush , we pitch ; to-ta-kush , they will beat , etc.
Periphrastic forms containing the verb substantive are royo-to , he lives ; raku-ta-to , he is grazing , and probably also bura-ch-to , he will come .
A k suffix occurs in na-shi-k , sits ; hashi-g-eg , is ; sukh-ne-k ’ , there is peace ; bo-ke , they go ; raṇ-kek ’ , they give , etc.
Such forms are commonly used as past tenses .
Past time .
The usual suffixes of past time are apparently me or mo and k , ke , or ge ; thus , shaṇ-mo-g , I did ; to-me-k , I struck ; bura-ke-k , I have come ; to-me-ng , we struck ; bo-ke-ng , we went ; khang-me-n , boughtest ; bo-ke-n , wentest ; bo-k , went ; wat-k , laughed ; mil-ek , was found ; bura-k , came ; richi-mo , he asked ; raṇ-muk ’ , he gave ; shaṇ-mug , he did ; ts ha-mek , he heard ; bo-ke , they went ; bhur-muk , they left .
The suffixes kun or kũ and kush are used as in the present time .
Forms such as hashig and hashik , became ; achig , arose , have already been mentioned under the head of present time .
Imperative .
The base alone can be used as an imperative ; thus , raṇ , give ; ach , be .
The final ng in forms such as pi-chi-ng , put ; ka-ng , bring , is perhaps a plural suffix .
Compare the final ng in verbal forms of the first and second persons plural .
There are apparently some imperative suffixes such as ke , t , and u ; compare ts hud-ke , bind ; bung-t , go ; ra-ṭ , give ; lā-u , put ; to-muk , beat .
Note also pi-chi-gu-n , make me , which apparently contains a suffix gu denoting an object of the first person , and another suffix n denoting the subject .
Passive voice .
There does not appear to be any passive voice .
Verbal nouns and participles .
The usual verbal nouns are formed by adding the suffix m or miz ; thus , yang-m , to live ; la-miz , to wear .
Forms such as hashi-ta , to be ; boda , to spare , are apparently identical with the usual base of the present time .
The reduplicated base is used as a participle ; thus , za-za , eating ; to-to , beaten .
The usual tense bases are probably also used as participles .
Negative voice .
The negative particle is a prefixed ma ; thus , ma-raṇ , did not give ; ma-yag , did not wish .
The vowel of ma seems to be rather faint , and has a tendency to approach the initial vowel of the verb in sound ; compare me ken-ken , didst not give ; mu tutash , does not come .
Order of words .
The order of words is said to be comparatively free .
The usual succession , however , is subject , object , verb .
For further details the student is referred to the specimens which follow and to the list of Standard Words and Phrases on pp .
Number of speakers .
Appendix A contains numerals , and Appendix B personal pronouns in Magar .
Some of the most usual case-suffixes are likewise Aryan .
Pronunciatioṇ Mãgarī possesses the vowels a , e , i , o , and u .
The vowels are sometimes marked as long and sometimes as short .
Really long vowels are , however , said to exist only in borrowed words .
M , n , r , and l are frequently aspirated , and the same is , according to Mr.Beames , the case with all consonants in excited talk ; thus , ḍhānghonhe , I see , I see , instead of ḍāngone .
On the other hand , the dentals are said to have the same sound as the English dentals .
Article .
There are no articles , but the numeral kat , one , is used as an indefinite article .
Nouns .
The prefix mi is common in words denoting parts of the body ; thus , ngo mi-talu , my head .
It is probably a demonstrative pronoun .
Another prefix ar occurs in forms such as ar-min , name .
Gender .
The natural gender is distinguished by using different words or by adding qualifying affixes ; thus , bhar-mī , man ; māhazā , woman : thor , bull ; nyet , cow : chü , dog ; chü-mān , or , chu : chhauri , bitch : len-zā mi-zā , son ; māsto mi-zā , daughter : dārhyā mirga , a male deer ; murli mirgā , a female deer .
Number .
The plural is not marked if it appears from the context .
Case .
The subject of intransitive verbs and the object are not distinguished by any suffix .
The dative suffix ke or kī is , however , often used to denote the object ; thus , ho-chu : mi-zā-ko ngo : dāthuk-ā , his son-to me-by struck , I have beaten his son .
The suffix ke , kī , is probably Aryan .
The suffix of the case of the agent , which is used to denote the subject of transitive verbs , is e or i ; thus , bhar-mi-y-e , by a man ; mi-za-i , by the son .
After vowels this suffix is occasionally dropped , or , rather , it is contracted into one sound with the preceding vowel ; thus , bai , by the father .
The suffix of the dative is ki or ke , as has been already remarked .
The suffix of the genitive is o or u ; thus , bay-o , of a father ; des-ũ , of a country .
A preceding vowel is sometimes contracted into one sound with this suffix .
In forms such as bhar-mi-kung , of a man , the final vowel has been accompanied by a nasalization .
The suffix of the locative is āng ; thus , im-āng , in the house .
Other relations are indicated by adding postpositions .
Adjectives .
Adjectives precede the noun they qualify in the nominative .
They very often end in the suffix chü , which is usually written cha or chha , in the specimens ; thus , karang-chü , big .
The particle of comparison is denang ; thus , hochu : bhai hochu : bahini denang ghyān-chu : le , his brother his sister than tall is , his brother is taller than his sister .
Numerals .
The first numerals are given in the list of words .
Numerals precede the word they qualify .
Pronouns .
The following are the personal pronouns : Other forms are kān-kurik , we ; nāng-kurik , you ; nāko and nākun , you , honorific ; nā-kruk , you ( plural ) , and so forth .
Demonstrative pronouns are is and isai , this ; ās and āsai , that .
Hos , he , is also used as a demonstrative pronoun .
Interrogative pronouns are su , who ?
Indefinite pronouns are formed by adding the indefinite particle ra to interrogatives ; thus , su-ye-ra , by any one ; hi-ra , anything .
There are no relative pronouns .
It is , however , combined with the relative participle , and not with the finite tenses of the verb .
Note finally the reflexive pronoun laho , own .
Verbs .
The verb is still in all essential points a noun .
There is no difference for person .
A suffix s is , it is true , often added in the second person ; thus , nāng nung-le and nāng nung-les , thou goest .
Verb substantive .
The usual verb substantive is le or le-sā , past leyā or lā .
A compound form is ā-le , is , which is also used as a future .
Other forms are supplied from the base ts hān , to be , to become , which is borrowed from Naipālī chha ; thus , ngā ts hān-ki hik-le , I can be , I may be .
Finite verb .
The verb substantive is extensively used in the formation of the various tenses of finite verbs .
Present time .
The usual form of the present tense is a compound , the verb substantive being added to the base ; thus , ũ-le , he lives ; dāthuk-le , I strike .
A compound present is formed by adding m-ne or mi-ne , i.e., the verb substantive and the suffix of the conjunctive participle .
Mr.Beames gives mo-ne , or , after consonants , o-ne , instead , and calls this form an aorist because it is used with reference to past , present , or future occurrences .
Mr.Beames also mentions a suffix lang or nang ; thus , nang-ke sāt-nang , I will strike you ; rākh-lang , I bring .
According to the same authority the base is sometimes also used alone as a present ; thus , jai : ki ma jaї , will you eat or not ?
Past time .
Nung-ne , went , and similar forms , probably also belong to the present time .
The usual suffix of past time , on the other hand , is ā ; thus , zāt-ā , did ; nung-ā , went ; de-y-ā , said , and so forth .
Forms such as ũ-le-sā , lived ; nung-le-sā , went , are apparently also only used with the meaning of a past .
Yā-nhi , gave , is probably another form of the present ya-ne , gives .
A real past is apparently the form ts hān-sī , it became .
Future .
The present is commonly used as a future ; thus , dāthuk-le , I shall beat .
There seems to be , besides a future suffix , ing ; thus , lou kān moja zāt-ing , well we shall make merry .
A future is also formed by prefixing ā and suffixing e ; thus , ā-de-y-e , I shall say ; ā-rākh-e , shall bring .
Imperative .
The suffix of the imperative is o ; thus , rākh-o , bring .
Bases ending in ā change this ā to o or e and insert an h before o , or else a-o becomes o ; thus , yā-ke , to give ; yo-h-o , ye-h-o , and yo , give .
A more polite imperative is formed by adding the suffix ni ; thus , yā-ni , give ; kher-ni , run .
Verbal nouns and participles .
The usual verbal noun is formed by adding the suffix ki or ke ; thus , yā-ke , to give ; zāt-ki , to do .
Forms such as yā-khī , to give , show the common aspiration of the initial consonant .
An infinitive of purpose is formed by adding lai to this form ; thus , was-kī-lai , in order to tend .
Relative participles are formed by adding the suffix chü , which is usually written cha in the specimens ; thus , yā-khī parī-cha ansa , to-give proper-being share , the share which I shall get ; hose dhut .
This form is sometimes also used as a verbal noun ; thus , harkha zāt-cha , to make merry ; ku-chi birin-chu : āle , whom-by sending may be ?
The conjunctive participle is formed by adding mü , or , after consonants , nu : ; thus , yā-mü , having given ; rākh-nü , having brought .
An adverbial participle , which also has the meaning of a conjunctive participle , is formed by adding the suffix nā or nāng ; thus , de-nā , saying ; rā-nāng , on coming .
Passive voice .
There is no passive voice .
Causative verb .
Some causatives are apparently formed by adding k ; thus , rā-ke , to come ; rāk-ke , to bring ; bilāk-nu , causing to put on , from bilh-ke , to put on .
Negative particle .
The negative particle is a prefixed mā ; thus , mā le , I am not ; mā yā , thou didst not give .
The usual order of words is subject , object , verb .
This Paṭṭanī dialect is spoken in the Kadi division of Baroda , in Mahikantha including the outlying Parantij-cum Modasa sub-division of the Ahmedabad district and in the greater part of the state of Palanpur .
On the east it has the various Bhīl dialects of Mahikantha , and on the south it has the village dialect of Ahmedabad , with which it is closely connected .
Paṭṭaṇī possesses all the peculiarities of the village dialect of Ahmedabad , its only real difference being that it possesses these peculiarities in a higher degree , and exhibits them more regularly .
The vowel a is changed to ī in dīyā for dayā , compassion .
As usual , ā is often pronounced as a broad ô , and is written , in the Gujarātī character # .
Such are hama or ham ã , now ; karyu for kary ũ , it was done ; nē or nē~ , the sign of the dative ; khātā~-tā~ , they ( masculine ) were eating .
The oblique plural is often nasalized as in gharā~ , houses ; nōkᵃrā~ , servants , instead of the standard gharō , nōkᵃrō .
The letters ch and chh are regularly pronounced as s , and are usually written so .
Indeed so entirely identical are the sounds represented by the Gujarātī letters # , # , and # that they are 
Other examples of the pronunciation of these letters are sākᵃrī .
Very similarly , when the letter g is followed by ī , ē , or y , it is pronounced ( and written ) j .
There is the usual confusion of cerebral and dental letters .
The letters s and ś regularly become h .
I have not noted any instances in which h is dropped , but aspiration is lost in words like ēkᵃtu , for ēkᵃṭh ũ , in one place ; hātī , for hāthē , on the hand .
Nouns .
The declension of nouns closely follows standard Gujarātī .
The neuter as often as not ends in u , instead of ũ , owing to the free way in which a final nasal is employed .
For the same reason , the termination of the dative is nē or nē~ .
Nouns ending in a consonant , even when masculine , have a plural in ā~ .
The agent-locative ends in ī , instead of ē .
Pronouns .
The agent case of the first person singular is mī~ or mī .
Verbs .
The verb substantive is thus conjugated in the present , The negative verb substantive is nathī , is not .
The past is hatō ( as in standard Gujarātī ) , often contracted to tō .
The negative past is natō , was not , as in nat ũ āpyu , was not given .
The Definite Present of the finite verb is thus conjugated .
The varieties of form are mainly due to the lax use of the final nasal .
The future , I shall strike , is thus conjugated , The Present and Past Parṭiciples are as in s tandard Gujarātī , with a few irregularities .
The past participle of jaw ũ , to go , is jyō , gyō , or jēlō .
The following are the numbers of speakers : Further particulars and a list of authorities will be found under Banjōgī .
Concurrent vowels are occasionally contracted , thus ā-pān and ā-pā-in , his father , etc.
The same inconsisteney prevails with regard to consonants .
In Southern Chin according to Mr.Houghton , kl regularly corresponds to tl in Lushēi , and the occurrence of both in Pānkhū may be due to the double influence of the two former languages .
The prefix pa in the first numerals is generally written pha ; thus pha-kāt , one .
In the same way we find the male suffix pā written phā in nāo-phā , younger brother ; but ū-pā , elder brother .
Concurrent consonants may be assimilated ; thus , khāk-ka for khāt-kā , one .
Consonants are sometimes doubled between vowels ; thus , kappā or kā-pā , my father ; kānnūng , back , i.e., kā-nūng , my back ; innā , in the house , etc.
Articles .
The numeral khāt-kā , one , is used as an indefinite article .
Definiteness is marked by using demonstrative pronouns or relative clauses .
In the list of words the suffix kā in khāt-kā is once used alone as an indefinite article ; thus pā kā , a father .
Nouns .
Gender seems only to be apparent in the case of animate beings .
Pā is the common male suffix , and nū the corresponding female one .
Another set of suffixes is ch.āl, male , and ( ā- ) pūi , female .
It is also possible to add the noun the gender of which is indicated as an adjective to some word meaning ‘ male ’ or ‘ female being ’ .
Number is only indicated when it does not appear from the context .
E only occurs in vok-e , the pigs , and is perhaps no plural suffix .
Jā or zā means ‘ all ’ in Lushēi , Lai , and other languages .
As a plural suffix it may be used alone , or together with other suffixes , e.g., ngei .
Ngei occurs as a plural suffix in Kōm , Hallām , Banjōgī , etc., and means ‘ many ’ , ‘ very ’ .
I cannot analyse the remaining plural suffix kup , which is used alone or together with ngei .
The Nominative and the Accusative do not take any suffix .
The suffix in , denoting the agent , is generally added to the subject of a transitive verb .
The i in in is occasionally dropped after a preceding vowel .
The suffix in is however often omitted , especially in the list of words .
noun ; thus , kā-pā sūa-pūi nāo , my father ’ s brother ’ s son , the son of my uncle .
The list of words seems to contain a genitive suffix tū ; thus , nū-nāo khāk-kā ṭū , of a daughter .
It is not probable that tū is a real suffix of the genitive and it does not occur as such in any sentence .
In kā-pā-chū shea-lo kāmā-bul-ta , my father ’ s hired servants , the governed word has been repeated before the governing one by means of the pronoun chū .
Adjectives .
Adjectives usually follow , but occasionally also precede , the noun they qualify .
In the former case postpositions and suffixes are added to the adjective and not to the qualified noun .
The suffix of comparison is nāk-ān or nāk-ā chūn ; thus , ā-chūa-pūi-pā ā-char-nū nāk-ān an-chāng , his brother his sister than tall , his brother is taller than his sister ; o-mā ( i.e., ā-mā ) nāk-ān ā-chā , that than good , better .
The superlative is formed in the same way , but nal is added to the adjective .
Numerals .
The numerals are given in the list of words .
The prefix pa ( written pha ) is a generic particle .
It is not used when the numeral refers to money ; thus , tānkā ni nūng-un ā-dā-li , rupees two and a half .
The suffix kā is probably the same as in jā-kā , many , all .
Compare the suffix kā after the numerals in Hallām , etc.
The numerals generally follow , but occasionally also precede , the noun they qualify .
Pronouns .
The following are the Personal pronouns : Singular , Plural , To these must be added the forms kan , our , and nin , your .
which occur among the pronominal prefixes ; see Verbs , below .
Ho is apparently a demonstrative pronoun ; thus , ā-ni nāo ho , his son that , ā-ni ho thin thoy-ā ān-tha^-rāo , he that tree under sitting-is .
The ordinary case suffixes may be added to the personal pronouns .
Demonstrative pronouns .
The pronoun chū is added to other words in order to emphasise ; thus , kei-chū , I ; nang-ni-chū , you ; kā pā chū , my father ; ā-tsūm chū , his property .
Relative pronouns .
Their place is supplied by the use of relative participles and the noun of agency .
Interrogative pronounṣ Ā-tū , who ?
The interrogative particle mēn may be added .
Indefinite pronouns .
Verbs .
Verbs are conjugated in person and number by means of pronominal prefixes .
These prefixes are often dropped , but this fact may be due to inadvertence .
Thus , kā and ā are occasionally used as plural prefixes .
In the second person the imperative is given instead of all other forms , and before the imperative the prefixes are regularly dropped .
240 the prefix of the second person singular is given as mē , probably a miswriting for nē , etc.
The root alone is freely used to denote present and past tenses .
The suffix of the Present definite is given as roa or rāo , compare Lai leo .
The corresponding Imperfect seems to be formed with the suffix en ; thus , kei-mā ( n ) kā jel-en , I was beating .
This form is probably also a present definite , compare the corresponding suffix ēn in Rāngkhōḷ Another suffix of the imperfect is perhaps ti ; thus , mi riem-ti , ēi-ti , bar-ti , the men feasted , ate , feeded .
The suffixes of the Past tenses are tā and roa ; thus , kā chūan-tā , I did ; ā ti-tā , he said ; kei-chū kā kal-roa , I went .
The form in roa seems to be identical with the form for the present definite mentioned above .
The suffix of the Future is ti and the pronominal prefixes are inserted between the root and the suffix .
Another future suffix seems to be āt ; thus , kā-ti-āt , I shall die , I am dying ; kei-mā ā-jel-āt , me he strike will , I shall be struck .
