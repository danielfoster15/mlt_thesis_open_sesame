The negative with imperatives is a prefixed na .
Nouns .
The prefix ūm in ūm-pā , father ; ūm-dhābmi , husband ; ūm-lēpa , day , and so on , is by origin a demonstrative pronoun ; compare ūm , his , her , its .
Gender is distinguished by using different terms , or else by adding suffixes or words indicating the sex .
There are three numbers , the singular , the dual , and the plural .
The suffix chī , which appears to be a dual suffix , is also added in the plural ; thus , ūmmā māni-mā-chī , female cats .
The genitive is expressed by putting the governed before the governing word without any suffix ; thus , pich-chhā , cow ’ s young , calf .
The suffix mi , mu , can be added ; thus , tā-mu sām , head-of hair .
It is by origin a demonstrative pronoun ; compare Bāhing mi .
Other relations are indicated by means of postpositions .
Numerals .
The first numerals are given in the table on p .342 .
Pronouns .
The following are the personal pronouns : The from meko-chi , they , is by origin a dual .
The suffix mi can be added to the genitive of all pronouns ; thus , ang-kā-mi , mine and theirs .
The pronouns of the third person are also used as demonstrative pronouns ; thus , moko and moko-ngā , that .
The nearer demonstrative is noko or noko-ngā , this .
Interrogative pronouns are āsā and āsāle , who ?
The indefinite particle is sāng , also ; thus , āsā-sāng , anybody ; yõ-sāng , anything .
Verbs .
We are very unsatisfactorily informed about the use of pronominal suffixes in order to denote the person and number of the subject and object , and about the formation of tenses .
The suffixes chu , or chi , num or ni , respectively , are added to an imperative in order to denote a subject of the second person dual and plural , respectively .
The suffix ān , i.e.
probably ā~ , is used to indicate an object of the first person singular in pī-ān , give me .
The forms yē , in-chhūng and in-ngā , it is , yes , seem to show that the base alone , and with one of the suffixes chhūng and ngā , can be used as a present .
The mere base is also used as an imperative ; thus , nē , take ; mō , do .
Other imperatives are formed by adding ō , ū , and ā ; thus , chō , eat ; dūng-ū , drink ; yosu , strike ; ipsā sleep ; bānā , come , etc.
We do not know anything about the meaning of the consonants preceding the final vowel of such imperatives .
The negative particle is a prefixed mā or man ; thus , mā-nā , not-is , no ; man-duwako , not ripe , raw .
Hodgson also mentions a negative suffix īsi .
The negative with imperatives is na .
Nouns .
The prefix ūm in ūm ’ pā , faher ; ūm ’ mā , mother , etc., is identical with the pronoun ūm , his , her , its .
Gender is distinguished by using different words or by adding suffixes or words such as ūm ’ pā , umprūpa , male ; ūm ’ mā , ummrūma , female .
There are three numbers , the singular , the dual , and the plural .
The suffix chi is said to be used both in the dual and in the plural ; thus , mik ’ , eye , dual and plural mi ’ chi .
In the case of adjectives we find a dual suffix chia and a separate plural suffix miha ; thus , nūyē , good , dual nuk-chia , plural nuk-miha .
The genitive is expressed by putting the governed before the governing word without any suffix ; thus , pi ’ pasā , cow ’ s young , calf .
If the governing word is understood , the suffix mi is added ; thus , kāngā-mi , mine .
Numerals .
The first numerals are given in the table on p .342 .
The forms ending in pang , bang , are used when the qualified noun denotes male or female 
I regret that up to the time of writing I have not succeeded in obtaining any specimens of this language .
Their language differs from village to village , but this is principally a matter of intonation and pronunciation .
As a whole the language has no marked dialects , though it might be equally true to say that every village has its own dialect .
Lhōtā is a distinct language from Āo , but is at the same time closely connected with it .
We may therefore class these Nāgā languages as a great tree with at least two boughs , one represented by Āo and Lhōtā , and the other by Angāmi , Rengmā , Kezhāmā , and Semā .
W.E., Outline Grammar of the Lhōtā Nāgā Language ; with a Vocabulary and Illustrative Sentences .
Lhōtā Nāgā , unlike Āo , abounds in aspirated consonants .
Tones play an important part in Lhōtā .
At present there is no information available concerning them except that the syllable of negation is always pronounced on a much higher key than the rest of the word to which it is prefixed .
The voice always falls at the end of a sentence , and in double interrogatives , in which the verbal root is reduplicated , the first syllable of the interrogative verb is spoken on a much higher key than the rest of the sentence .
Prefixes and Suffixes .
In addition to prefixes used to make forms corresponding to declension and conjugation , the following should be noted .
Nearly every noun takes the prefix ō , which is again dropped when a possessive or other modifying word unites with it to form a word of two or more syllables .
This prefix corresponds to the prefix ā which is met in Semā , Rengmā , and Mongsen Āo , and to the Kezhāmā e.The prefix e , corresponding to the te or t of Āo , is used before nouns , adjectives , and gerunds , has no formative significance , and may be assumed or thrown off at pleasure .
Examples of this prefix will be found below .
Nouns of agency are formed by the suffix e~ , with or without the prefix e.Thus , shisho , to trade , shishoe~ , a trader ; vü , to sew , e-vü-e~ , a tailor .
Another suffix having a similar force is wōchī or mōchī .
This corresponds to the Āo suffix er , and the Angāmi suffix u .
This suffix , which corresponds to the relative particle of Dravidian languages , is of frequent occurrence .
Mr.Witter gives the following excellent example of the way in which nouns , adjectives , and verbs are in their root forms indistinguishable from one another .
The force of the indefinite article is conveyed by suffixing the indefinite pronouns matsangā or ntsangā , a certain .
The numeral e-khā , one , is only used in counting , and not as an article .
The force of the definite articles is given by suffixing the demonstrative pronouns shī , this , or chī , that .
More often , however , the relative particle wōchī , or wōchu : is suffixed .
These articles are only used when ambiguity would result from their absence .
For human relations , different words are used to indicate gender .
Number is only indicated when this is rendered necessary by the context .
In this case , the indefinite article is used to indicate the singular , and , usually , the plurals of the demonstrative proncuns , shī-āng , chī-āng , etc., to denote the plural .
There is no plural suffix corresponding to the Āo tam .
Nouns of multitude are # so added to form the plural .
Also the suffix dī , as in korr-dī , horses .
There is a rudimentary dual , as in Āo and Angāmi .
The syllable tō is frequently suffixed when two or more objects are spoken of in succession .
Case is indicated by postpositions .
The sign of the nominative , when it is the subject of a transitive verb , is nā .
When there are two or more nominatives to the same verb , the nā is only suffixed to the last .
This nā is evidently the sign of the case of the Agent , and the literal translation of the foregoing sentence is ‘ by your brother and my brother a tiger was slain ’ .
The suffix corresponds to the Kezhāmā nyi .
When the nominative is the subject of an intransitive verb it either takes the suffix , cho , or has no suffix at all .
The accusative case takes no suffix .
When a verb has also an indirect object , it stands between the direct object and the verb .
This case is formed by the suffix nā , as in ā-nā ō-nung-nā shī e-phīā-tsang-cho , I slew him with a stone .
Dative .
The suffixes are ī , thenī and thingī , to , and o , etchī , etchu : and etsconā , for .
Ablative .
The suffix is nā , as in ā kī-nā rō-chō , I came from my house .
The suffixes are ī , in ; o or lo , on ; and we or wī , in the direction of , on , upon ; or other postpositions may be used .
When a noun is followed by an adjective in agreement with it , the postposition is added to the latter .
Adjectives .
Adjectives usually , but not always , follow the nouns they qualify The suffix wōchī , or one of its varieties , is very commonly used with adjectives , as in the example just given .
Comparison is indicated by suffixing wō , gone , to the adjective .
The suffix is liable to be euphonically changed to mō or ō .
The numerals will be found in the list of words .
The following ordinals are given by Mr.Witter : ovūngōchü , the one in front , first .
The Personal pronouns are Nom .
The Demonstrative pronouns are used for the third person .
The Possessive pronouns are as illustrated below .
The Demonstrative pronouns , both of which are used as pronouns of the third person , are , 1 .shī , hī , this , he ; shī tō ōnī , these two ; shīāng , shīā~ , shīānō , hīang , these , they .
The Interrogative pronouns are ō-chī , ō-chō , who ?
The force of the Relative pronoun is usually given by the relative suffix wōchī , etc., he who is .
Sometimes the interrogative pronoun is used as a relative , and is then followed by a demonstrative .
The Reflexive pronoun is mōchī or mōmō , self .
The ideas of time and mood are conveyed by prefixes and suffixes added to the root .
The verb does not change for number or person .
The use of the prefix e has already been referred to .
The following are the principal tenses of the verb tsō , eat : Present .
Present definite .
Same as second form of present , ā-nā tsō-ā-lā , I was eating .
Past .
Future .
Imperative .
Participles and Gerunds .
The same form sometimes has the power of an-adjective , i.e., participle , and sometimes that of a verbal noun , i.e., gerund .
Classifying them according to time referred to , we have the following suffixes and prefixes : 
The past conditional is formed with wō in the protasis , and kàtōlā in the apodosis .
Compound verbs .
As in Āo , a large number of particles can be added to a root in order to modify its meaning .
There are also prefixes used with a similar result .
Passive voice .
As in Āo , roots may be used either in an active or in a passive signification .
Negative forms are indicated by the prefix n or m , except in the imperative mood , where it is tī .
The negative prefixes are pronounced as separate syllables , and always in a higher key than the rest of the word .
The Interrogative particles are ke and nung , which are attached to the verb .
Double interrogatives double the verbal root , and , in the past tense , take the termination ēlā .
Adjectives and articles usually follow the nouns they qualify .
The thing possessed follows the possessor .
The subject usually commences the sentence , and the verb usually ends it .
Marāṭhī is the principal language of Berar and of the southern part of the Central Provinces .
It has already been mentioned that the usual Dekhan form of the language is current in the western part of Buldana , and in some districts to the north of the Satpuras , which formerly belonged to the dominions of the Peshwas .
The dialect spoken over the greater part of Berar and in the south of the Central Provinces is , however , slightly different .
Area in which spokeṇBeginning from the west this dialect covers the eastern part of Buldana , leaving the western border to Standard Marāṭhī .
The dialect is further spoken by scattered settlers in Raipur , Bilaspur , Nandgaon , Kawardha , and Bombay Town and Island .
Name of the dialecṭThe Marāṭhī of Berar is usually spoken of as Varhāḍī or Bērārī , and Nāgpurī is the traditional name of the dialect spoken in the Central Provinces .
Both names have been retained , in deference to the traditional usage , though they in reality connote the same form of speech .
Several smaller dialects of Marāṭhī have been returned from the districts under consideration .
Spoken abroad in It has been stated above that several minor dialects which were originally returned from Berar and the Central Provinces have proved to be local forms of the current Marāṭhī of the said districts .
Of these minor dialects the Marhēṭī of Balaghat has been slightly influenced by the neighbouring dialects of Eastern Hindī , and the Natakānī of Chanda has , in some points , accommodated itself to Telugu .
On the whole , however , the various forms of speech enumerated in the table are essentially identical with the form of Marāṭhī commonly spoken in Berar and the Central Provinces .
This form of speech has also largely influenced the dialect of the Katiās of Chhindwara and Narsinghpur , which has therefore been dealt with after the minor dialects just mentioned .
We thus arrive at the following total for the Marāṭhī of Berar and the Central Provinces : In connection with this form of speech it has been found convenient to deal with some broken dialects spoken in the Bastar State , Kanker , and Raipur , which have been largely influenced by the neighbouring Marāṭhī .
GrammaṛThe Marāṭhī spoken in Berar and the Central Provinces is closely related to the form which that language assumes in the Dekhan .
The difference between the two forms of speech is slight , and they gradually merge into each other in Buldana .
Long vowels , and especially final ones , are very frequently shortened ; thus , mī and mi , I ; māhi bāyᵃkō , my wife ; māhā and mahā , my .
As in the Konkan , an a is very commonly used where the Dekhan form of the language has an ē , especially in the termination ē~ of neuter bases , in the suffix nē~ of the instrumental , and in the future .
In some rustic dialects this short final a is occasionally dropped altogether ; thus , tyān , by him , in the so-called Dhanᵃgarī and Gōvārī of Chhindwara .
The cerebral ḍ , when preceded by a vowel , is pronounced as an r .in the so-called Māhārī of Chhindwara .
The same is probably also the case in the rustic dialects in other districts .
Thus , in the so-called Dzhāṛpī and Kōshṭī of Ellichpur we find forms such as ghōḷā , a horse , and in the dialect of the Kuṇᵃbīs of Akola d.is substituted for l .in words such as dzavaḍ , near .
All these facts can only be explained on the assumption that the cerebral l .has a sound which is very near to that of a cerebral ṛ , and that the cerebral d.after vowels assumes the same sound .
Nouns .
The substitution of a for ē~ in neuter bases , together with the tendency to shorten long final vowels , has caused the distinction between the masculine and neuter genders to be weakened .
Mānᵃsa , men , which is a neuter plural , is frequently combined with an adjective in the masculine gender ; thus , tsāṅgᵃlē mānᵃsa , good men , and so on .
In the dialect of the Kuṇᵃbīs of Akola and Chanda , of the Gōvārs of Chanda and Bhandara , in the Marhēṭī of Balaghat , the Marāṭhī dialect of Raipur , and so on , the masculine and neuter genders are constantly confounded .
The neuter gender is thoroughly preserved only in Marāṭhī and Gujarāṭī , and it will therefore be seen that the dialect of Berar and the Central Provinces in this respect forms a link between those languages and the related forms of speech to the north and east .
The plural is formed as in Standard Marāṭhī .
In the oblique form plural , however , hī or ī is often added ; thus , bāpāhīs , to fathers ; mānᵃsāi-lē , to men .
The case suffixes are the same as in the Dekhan .
The dative , however , is formed by adding lē and not lāin most of the rustic dialects such as the Kuṇᵃbī of Akola and 
Pronouns .
The case of the agent of the personal pronoun of the second person is tyā , by thee ; ‘ my ’ is māh.ā, and ‘ thy ’ is tuhā .
The demonstrative pronoun tō , that , is , in most respects , inflected as in the Dekhan .
The usual form of the nominative singular feminine is , however , tē as in Old Marāṭhī .
has an ablative kāvhun or kāhun , why ?
is a compound meaning ‘ what having said ?’ Verbs .
There is only one conjugation ; thus , mī marᵃtō , I die ; mī mārᵃtō , I strike ; mī mhanīn , I shall say ; mī karīn , I shall do ; mī asal , or asīn , I shall be , and so on .
The second person singular has ụsually the same form as the third person ; thus , tū āhē , thou art ; tū gēlā , thou wentest .
Similarly the second person plural of the past tense coincides with the third person ; thus , tumhī gēlē , you went ; tē gēlē , they went .
The verb substantive is , with the above exceptions , regular .
In the first person singular of the present tense , however , we find mī āhō and mī āhē , I am .
From the root hō is formed mī vhay , I am , etc.
In the past tense vha is interchangeable with hō ; thus , tū hōtā or vhatā , thou wast .
The present tense of finite verbs is often formed as in the Dekhan ; thus , mī karᵃtō , I do ; tū karᵃtō ( s ) , thou dost ; tē karᵃtāt , they do .
Frequently , however , the second and third persons singular and the third person plural are formed in the same way as in the verb substantive , in which case the verb does not change for gender ; thus , tu rāhᵃtē ( s ) , thou livest ; tō yētē , he comes ; tō karᵃtyē , he does ; tē dzātēt , they go .
In Berar a is substituted for ē in the terminations of the second person singular and the third person plural ; thus , tū mārᵃta , thou strikest ; tē mārᵃtat , they strike .
In the imperative we may note forms such as dzāy , go ; khāy , eat ( Berar ) ; pāhya , see .
The habitual past is often used as an ordinary past .
The first person singular ends in ō in the only instance which occurs in the materials available ; thus , mī nidzō , I used to sleep .
The past tense is formed as in the Dekhan ; thus , myā mārᵃla , I struck ; tyā mārᵃla , thou struckest .
The third person singular of transitive verbs sometimes ends in an ; thus , dhāḍᵃlan , sent .
Such forms occur in the rustic dialects of Ellichpur , Chhindwara , and Bhandara .
The past tense of transitive verbs is used in the same way as in the Dekhan , the subject being put in the case of the agent , and the verb agreeing with the object in gender and number or being put in the neuter singular .
In some rustic dialects in Chhindwara , Bhandara , and Balaghat , however , the influence of the neighbouring dialects of Eastern Hindī has caused the passive and impersonal constructions to be frequently superse.dedby the active one , and we find forms such as mī pāp kēlō , I sinned .
In the future we must note forms such as mī asal , I shall be ; tū mārᵃsīn , thou wilt strike ; tē mārᵃtīn , they will strike .
In the dialect of the Kuṇᵃbīs of Akola we find a form tumhī mārᵃsān , instead of mārāl , you will strike .
Note also forms such as pāhādzōs , thou wilt see , which are properly a future imperative .
The verbal noun is formed as in the Dekhan .
The base alone seems to be used as a verbal noun , with oblique forms ending in yā , ā , and āy .
On the whole , however , grammar and vocabulary are the same as in the form of Marāṭhī current in the Dekhan .
The principal language of the whole district has been returned as Varhāḍī and closely agrees with the form of Marāṭhī described in the preceding pages .
The estimated figures for the two dialects are as follows .
The total number of speakers in Akola has been estimated at 465 , 600 , and there remain thus 4,000 regarding whom we are unable to tell to which of the two dialects they belong .
To this total must be added 1,000 individuals who have been returned as speaking Nāgpurī , and the weavers and potters who have been reported to speak separate dialects .
The two specimens which follow illustrate the so-called Brāhmaṇī dialect .
The only points which need be noted are the use of the dative suffix lā and the frequency with which ya is substituted for i and ē , i.e.
Nīmāḍī is not the only language of Nīmāwaṛ .
There are hence two distinct tracts in which Nīmāḍī is spoken , but in both the language is practically the same .
Nīmāḍī is really a form of the Mālvī dialect of Rājasthānī , but it has such marked peculiarities of its own that it must be considered separately .
It has fallen under the influence of the neighbouring Gujarātī and Bhīl languages , and also of the Khāndēśī which lies to its south .
This runs through the entire grammar .
Thus the sign of the agent case is na , not nē , and of the locative ma , not mē~ .
Nīmāḍī is not fond of nasal sounds , and frequently drops them .
As in Mālvī and Khāndēśī , aspiration is often dropped , as in hāt , not hāth , a hand ; bhūkō , for bhūkhō , hungry .
The letters l and n are interchangeable as in līm and nīm , tree .
In the neighbouring Bhīl languages , both j and ch are commonly pronounced as s.In Nīmāḍī , ch seems to be pronounced according to its proper sound , but j is often interchanged with it .
In the specimens which come from Bhopawar such forms are always written with j .
The letter jh is often pronounced as a z , as in the Marāṭhī of Berar , and as in some forms of Khāndēśī .
In the declension of nouns , the common form in ē , which in Rājasthānī is used sometimes for the agent and sometimes for the locative , appears in Nīmāḍī as ending in a .
Strong masculine tadbhavas in ō , form their oblique form in ā , as in Mālvī .
To form the plural the termination nā is added to the oblique form singular .
The case postpositions are as follows .
Agent , na .
Accusative-dative , ka .
Instrumental-ablative , sī , sū .
Genitive , kō , ( kā , kī ) .
Locative , ma .
We occasionally find the Rājasthānī kā , and the Bundēlī khē ( under the form of kha ) used for the Accusative-dative .
The genitive postposition kō is used with a singular masculine noun in the direct orm , and kā with a masculine noun in the oblique form .
Kī is used with feminine nouns .
In two instances I have noted kā used to agree with feminine nouns .
Yē , this ; oblique inā or ē .Wō , he , that ; oblique unā , wō , ō , wa ; Pl .
wō ; oblique uṇ .
Jō , who ( singular and plural ) ; jē-kō , of whom ; oblique singular jē .
The influence of the Bhīl dialects and of Khāndēśī is most evident in the conjugation of the Nīmāḍī verb .
The present tense of the verb substantive is chhē , which ( like the Khāndēśī sē ) does not change for number or person .
The past tense of the verb substantive is thō ( thā , thī ) , as in Mālvī .
When used as an auxiliary verb chhē drops the final ē and its aspiration , and becomes ch , which in its turn ( especially in Bhopawar ) often bccomes j .
We thus get the following form of the present of mārᵃṇū , to strike .
Khāndēśī itself usually takes a simple s in the present , not sē .
The Pārᵃdhī Bhīl dialect uses ch like Nīmāḍī .
The future ( as in Gujarātī ) has s for its characteristic letter , and is conjugated as follows .
Sometimes we find the true Mālvī future formed by adding an unchangeable gā .
The infinitive ends in ṇū , thus , mārᵃṇū , to strike ; when used as a participle future passive , its subject is put in the case of the agent .
Thus , apaṇ-na anand manāwᵃṇū nī khūsī hōṇū , joy was meet to be celebrated and happiness was meet to be ( note that the participle is masculine although agreeing with a feminine noun ) by us .
The oblique form of the infinitive ends in ṇa , thus , mārᵃṇa-kō , of beating .
Its language is a recognised dialect of Gaṛhwālī , known as the Tehrī dialect , and also by people of Garhwal and Almora , as “ Gaṅgāpāriyā ” or the language of the country beyond the Ganges .
Immediately to the west of the Tehri State lies the Jaunsār-Bāwar tract of the District of Dehra Dun , the language of which is the Western Pahāṛī Jaunsārī .
It is unnecessary to give a complete sketch of the grammar of Tehrī Gaṛhwālī .
The locative postpositions are used after verbs of saying , like the Standard mā .
Substantives and adjectives make their oblique forms as in the Standard .
The plural oblique terminations are au and ū , both of which are frequently nasalized .
Adjectives follow the same rules as in the Standard .
Pronouns closely follow the Standard .
The usual oblique form of tū , thou , is twai , as in twai-na ( ag .
Similarly , the agent singular of maĩ , I , is mai-na or maĩ-na .
For yō , this , he , and wō , that , he , we have : The Reflexive Pronoun is āphū , self ; genitive apṇō .
The Relative and Correlative Pronouns are .
The Interrogative Pronouns are kō ( declined like jō ) , who ?
The Indefinite Pronouns are kuī ( obl .
The Verbs Substantive are .
Chha may also be used for any person , as in tū ab marna tyār chha , thou art ready to die .
The usual past is thayō , was ; plural thayā ; fem .
Finite Verb .
The Present Participle is formed as in the Standard , either with dō or ṇū ( nū ) .
The Past Participle also follows the Standard , ending in ē , yō , and yū~ , with oblique forms in ē , yā and yā~ .
As examples of the Future Passive Participle , we have in the second specimen ham-na kanū raṇa ( for rahṇa ) khāṇa , how is it to be dwelt , to be eaten , by us ?
The Imperative follows the Standard .
The Old Present occurs in hōū~ , I may be ; māraũ , I may strike ; jēū~ , let us eat ; mānaũ , let us celebrate .
The Present has two forms as in the Standard .
The first is a present definite , mārdō chhaũ , I am striking .
In the Parable we have a weak form of the Present Participle in dēnda thayō , ( no one ) was giving .
For the Future we have in the masculine : Similarly , jaulō , I will go ; bōllō , I will say ; rahlī ( fem .
The Past Tenses closely follow the Standard .
For intransitive verbs we have : rāyō , I remained ; chalyō , I went ; ghūmyō ( sentence 224 ) , I walked about , and also : Similarly , hōyē , he became ( 225 ) ; lagena , they began ; lyāyena , they brought ; ṭūṭena , they broke ( intransitive ) .
Note that sakī is treated as transitive .
The negative is ni .
The seat of the Rengmās is in the Năga Hills to the south of the Lhōtāṣ Unlike the latter , whose speech is connected with Āo , and belongs to the Central Sub-Group of Nāgā Languages , Rengmā belongs to the Western Sub-Group , and must be classed with Angāmi , Semā , and Kezhāmā .
The members of the tribe call themselves Unzâ , but about half speak what they call the Mâyi Language , and the others what they call the Unzâ .
The Rengmā Nāgās are closely allied to the Semāṣ In Themokedima , the largest village of the tribe , the people are bi-lingual , i.e., they all talk Semā ( Simi ) as well as their own language , and most of the village songs are sung in that tongue , and not in Rengmā .
A version of the Parable of the Prodigal Son and a list of words in this language have been obtained with considerable difficulty by the Deputy Commissioner of the Năga Hills .
So far as I have been able to collate the facts , I here give the principal peculiarities of Rengmā grammar .
The Prefixes ke , ka and the are used much as in Angāmi .
The prefix ā is , as in Semā , of very common occurrence .
There is a Suffix nyu or nyu : corresponding to the Angāmi mā or mi .
For the definite article , the prefix ā is used as shown above .
For the indefinite article , the numeral mē , one , is employed .
The only suffixes of gender which I have been able to identify are tsē for the masculine , and lē for the feminine .
The usual suffix of the plural seems to be dang , as in metu tsē-dang bulls .
The Nominative takes the suffix lē , much like the Āo e.This suffix is used before both transitive and intransitive verbs .
The termination , as in Āo , is omitted when no ambiguity will ensue .
The relative particle , corresponding to the Angāmi u is apparently gü , as in ā-nche-gü , the younger ; peshi-gü , the elder .
The Accusative takes no termination , as in ā-hong ā-pui un-kē-lā-lē , wasted the whole of his property .
The Genitive takes no termination , and precedes the noun that governs it , as in the-bd chu , swine ’ s food .
Other suffixes of case are kā or ki , to ; hu , to ; ki , from ; kā , in ; nyü , in ; ghenyü , from ; zanho , with .
Adjectives follow the nouns they qualify , and in that case , case- and number-suffixes are added to them , and not to the noun , as in reni kaje-ki , to a far country .
They take the prefix ke as in Angāmi , thus , ke-gwā , good .
It will have been noticed how economical Rengmā is in the use of the suffixes of case , the same syllable being used to illustrate such widely different ideas as ‘ to ’ and ‘ from ’ .
This is also strikingly true with the personal pronouns , those of the first and third persons being identical in form .
It is possible that in such cases the two words which are the same in appearance are distinguished by being pronounced with different tones , but no information is available on this point .
The following are the forms of the personal pronouns which I have noted : First person .
The list of words gives the plural as ā-pwi , aghu-nē , agun , hagha-lē .
The nē of the second form and the n of the third , may be corruptions of the Nominative suffix lē , or nē and n may be contracted forms of nyo .
The syllable ā is used as a pronominal prefix , meaning my , me , to me .
The - nyi in apürenyi is possibly the same as the suffix nyu .
Other cases are ā-kā , to him ; and ā common as a prefix , as in ā-pfü , his father ; ā-khu-lo-ho , seeing him .
For the plural the list of words gives apürenyi , and also haghu-nē .
As in Angāmi , the suffixes of the present and of the past tenses are the same , and the meaning of the verb must be concluded from the context .
The most common verb substantive is bi-nē , is or was .
As in other connected languages , the verbal suffixes can be added to substantives , adjectives , etc., as in u ’ - hong-nē , is thy property .
In the case of other verbs , the most usual suffix of the present is lē or nē as in vü-lē , beats ; tē-bi-nē is making .
In tē-bi-nyong , was doing , nyong apparently gives a continuative or durative sense .
An example of the simplest form of a past tense is zō-lē , said .
In un-kē-lā-lē , wasted , and gü-rā-lē , came back , lā and rā are infixes modifying the root-meaning , and not tense-signs .
Other forms translated as past tenses are pfsü-lā-tà , gave ; zō-yā , said ; ā-zō-hā-shi , ordered ; zō-ni-shi-lē , and zō-ni-shi , said .
The simplest form of the future is vü-ti , will strike .
The root gu : signifies ‘ go , ’ and gwā means ‘ good ’ .
As in Kezhāmā , the imperative ends sometimes in tà , and sometimes in lo .
Possibly it is only incorrect for the durative suffix nyong .
The causative particle , corresponding to the Angāmi bu is no , as in ā-pui-no ā-kanü-ti-lē , let us all be merry .
As an example of a desiderative verb , we may quote tē-bi-sü-bi-nē , wished to eat .
The negative particle is mo as in ā-tsü-mu-ho , not giving to him , here the mo is changed to mu , probably a false spelling ; ke-mo-tē-lā-si-lē and ke-mo-tē-lā-lē , did not , the root being tē , do ; sā-ri-mo-lē , broke-not ; ā-pfsü-mo-lē , did not give to me .
The Kāgate dialect of Tibetan is closely related to the so-called Sharpa and to the Tibetan of Sikkim .
The spelling of the specimens does not correctly reflect the actual pronunciation of the dialect .
Compare tin , classical Tibetan bdun , seven ; song and sing , the suffix of past time ; su and si , who ?
The letter e apparently also represents the sounds of a : in German ‘ Bär ’ and of o : in German ‘ bös ’ ; compare ne , Lhasa dialect nä , from ; te , Lhasa dialect dö , to sit , etc.
With regard to consonants it should be noted that the sounds j , dz , z , and zh are not correctly distinguished in the specimens .
The intermediate form , with an aspirated hard initial , occurs in phu , son .
On the other hand , hard initials are occasionally softened when preceded by vowels or nasals in compound words ; thus , tham-je , classical thams-chad , all .
With regard to final consonants g is usually changed to k , and b to p ; thus , chik , one ; phak , swine ; lep , arrive .
Final d is dropped and the preceding vowel is modified so that a becomes e ( i.e., probably a : ) , o becomes e , o , or oe , i.e., probably ö , etc.
Final n seems to exercise a similar influence on a preceding vowel .
Compare the suffix of the present participle ken or kin , Ladakhī mkhan .
A preceding vowel is modified , and probably lengthened ; thus , le , i.e., lā : , classical las , from ; nyī , classical gnyis , two .
In compound consonants containing a subscribed y as second component in classical Tibetan , this y is dropped before i and e ; thus , khi , classical khyi , dog ; pe , classical byed , do .
In other compounds the first consonant is dropped ; thus , lang , classical glang , bull ; lep , classical sleb , arrive ; kang-ba , classical rkang-ba , foot ; ta , classical rta , horse ; che , classical lche , tongue ; ke , classical skad , sound ; tong-bu , classical sdong-po , tree ; nang , classical gnang , give ; ngul , classical dngul , silver ; tin , i.e., tün , classical bdun , seven , and so forth .
Articles .
The numeral chik , one , is used as an indefinite , and the demonstrative pronoun di , this , as a definite article ; thus , mi chik , a man ; angsha-di , the share .
Nouns Gender .
Gender is distinguished by using different words or by adding qualifying affixes ; thus , no , brother ; nu-mu , sister : pu , son ; po-mo , daughter : ta-bu , horse ; ta-mu , mare .
Number .
The usual suffix of the plural is kya ; thus , aba-kya , fathers ; compare cha in Ḍänjong-kä .
Case .
The suffix of the genitive is i , ki , or gi after vowels , and i or ki after consonants .
The same form is also used as a case of the agent .
The definite article is often added in the genitive ; thus , aba chik-i-di , of a father .
Di is used alone as a genitive suffix in po-mu-di , of daughters .
Other cases are formed by adding suffixes such as la , in , to ; sa-le , from the place of , from ; minji , minjik , min-zi , min-zik , from ; dung-la , before , etc.
Adjectives .
Adjectives sometimes precede and sometimes follow the noun they qualify .
The particle of comparison is the Naipālī bhanda ; thus , kho-i a-zi bhanda no rim-bu-du , his sister than brother tall-is , his brother is taller than his sister .
Pronouns .
The following are the personal pronouns : The pronouns are inflected like nouns .
Other pronouns are di , this ; o and o-di , that ; su , who ?
Verbs .
The usual bases of the verb substantive are e and du .
In the past tense we find woe .
Finite verb .
The verb is still virtually a noun .
The subject of transitive verbs is put in the case of the agent , and the plural suffix kya can be added .
Present time .
A present is formed by adding yin to a participle ending in ka , pa , etc.
A compound present is formed by adding gu or ku , or , after vowels , u , and the verb substantive ; thus , chho-u-du , he is feeding ; kho-i rob-ku-du , he strikes ; te-ku-e , he lives ; ong-gu du-ba , he is coming .
Du-ba , is , in the last instance contains the usual suffix of the participle ; compare also ye-ba , they are .
To in rob-to , they strike , is probably the copula du .
Past time .
The participle ending in ba or pa is commonly also used as a past tense , especially in the second person ; thus , nyo-ba , I brought , thou broughtest ; kal-pa , wentest ; se-pa , killedest .
The most common past tense is formed by adding song , or , usually , sing , ( i.e., probably süng ) ; thus , gal-song and kal-sing , he went .
The common present is also used as a past ; thus , e-kin , i.e.
Future .
The present is also used as a future ; thus , don , I will go ; lap-ken , I will say ; ong-do , I shall be .
Imperative .
As in classical Tibetan , an a is often changed to o in the imperative ; thus , song , go ; so , eat ; long , stand .
The unaltered base is used in forms such as shi , die ; do , go ; ter , give .
Sometimes we find suffixes added such as kong , tong , dung , and ter ; thus , rob-kong ( i.e.
Verbal nouns and participles .
The most common verbal noun is formed by adding che , or , after vowels , ze ; thus , lap-che , to say ; do-ze , to go .
A suffix a occurs in charai-te-ya-la , in order to feed .
Relative participles are formed by adding ken or gen and ba .
The interrogative pronoun kan-di , which ?
Adverbial participles are formed by adding postpositions to the base ; thus , lap-na , saying-in , if you say ; ong-a-te-su , arriving-after , when he came .
Conjunctive participles are formed by adding di , ti , or di-ma-rang ; thus , rob-sing-di , having beaten ; kal-di-ma-rang , having gone .
Ma-rang is a postposition which governs the genitive .
It is therefore also added to the genitive of the base ; thus , sing-i-ma-rang , having been .
Negative particle .
The negative particle is a prefixed me or ma ; thus , kal-di me-ken , going not-were , did not go ; me-ter-ekin , not-giving-was , did not give ; ma-nyin , 
It will be seen that mat sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the verb .
Ahīrwāṭī , also called Hīrwāṭī and Ahīrwāl ( or the language of the Ahīr country ) is spoken in the west of the district of Gurgaon ( including the state of Pataudi ) .
Further north we have the Bāṅgarū dialect of Western Hindī , and the Ahīrwāṭī of Delhi and Rohtak , is much mixed with this dialect .
To the east of Ahīrwāṭī , in the central part of Gurgaon , and also south of Gurgaon , in the state of Alwar , the language is Mēwātī , of which Ahīrwāṭī is merely a variety .
Here , except in the north of the tract , where Bāṅgarū is spoken , the language is also Ahīrwāṭī .
The language of Narnaul of Patiala is also Ahīrwātī , but , as may be expected , it is much mixed with the surrounding dialects .
We thus see that Ahīrwāṭī represents the connecting link between Mēwātī and three other dialects , Bāṅgarū , Bāgṛī , and Shēkhāwāṭī .
Although it has one striking peculiarity , which appears all over the area which it occupies , I allude to the form taken by the verb substantive , it has in other respects various local varieties due to the influence of the neighbouring dialects .
Its backbone is , however , throughout Mēwātī , and it can only be classed as a form of that dialect of Rājasthānī .
speaking an Ahīr dialect .
The dialect of Rājasthānī spoken in Malwa is usually called Mālvī ( distinct from the Mālwaī dialect of Pañjābī ) , but is also called Ahīrī ; and that curious form of Gujarātī , which is half a Bhīl dialect , and which is generally known as Khāndēśī , also bears the name of Ahīrāṇī .
Nay more , between Khandesh and the Ahīrwāṭī country of Gurgaon there lies the wild hilly territory occupied by the Bhīls , whose language is nearly allied to that of Khandesh , and it is not impossible that , according to known phonetic rules , the word Bhilla or Bhīl should be explained as an old corruption of the word Ābhīra .
All these colonies of Ahīrs who have been described as possessing languages of their own , have been separated so widely , and for so many centuries , that it is not reasonable to expect that at the present day they should be found using the same form of speech , nor is this the case .
The most important of these is the use of the word sū~ to mean ‘ I am ’ which is typical of Ahīrwāṭī and its connected dialects , and is also common in Khāndēśī .
Literature , authoritieṣI know of no works written in Ahīrw#ṭī , and of no previous account of their language .
Grammar .
In its grammar Ahīrwāṭī differs but little from Mēwātī .
It is the stepping stone between that dialect and the Bāṅgarū dialect of Western Hindī spoken in Delhi , Rohtak , East Hissar , and Karnal .
In south Rohtak and in the Ḍābar tract of Delhi as we know , the language is actually Ahīrwāṭī .
I take the Ahīrwāṭī of Gurgaon as the standard .
The nominative of strong masculine nouns of the a base ends in ō , with an oblique singular in ā , thus agreeing with Mēwātī as against Bāṅgarū which has ā , with an oblique ē .
The same rule is followed in adjectives and in the suffixes of the genitive , it 
being understood that when they agree with nouns in the locative , they , as usual in Rājasthānī , end in ē , not ā .
Nouns of this class form the locative singular in ē or ai , as ghōṛē , or ghōṛai , in a horse .
Masculine nouns ending in consonants form the locative in ī , as in gharī , in a house The usual suffix of the dative is nai or nē~ , and the same suffix is also used for the case of the agent .
The genitive suffix is kō , as in Mēwātī .
The agent case is regularly used before the future passive participle , which is the same in form as the infinitive , as in tū-nē~ karᵃṇō thō , it was to be done by thee .
Note that the locative of the genitive is often used for the dative , e.g.
As usual , there are occasional instances of a neuter gender , as in dīṇū~ , that which is to be given .
The personal pronouns are as in Mēwātī .
Note the use of nē~ to form the agent case of these pronouns .
‘ Own ’ is apᵃṇū or apᵃnō , masculine oblique apᵃṇā .
The demonstrative pronouns are yō or yoh ( feminine yā ) , this , oblique singular aĩh or ãh , oblique plural in , often ased in the sense of the singular ; and wō or woh ( feminine wā , that ) , oblique singular waĩh or wãh or ū~ , oblique plural un , also often used as a singular .
As usual the relative pronoun is often employed in the sense of a demonstrative .
In other respects , the pronouns follow Mēwātī .
Probably the oblique singular of jō and kaun .
In verbs , the only thing to note is the verb substantive .
In the present this is : The past is thō , was , feminine thī , masculine plural thā .
The saĩ of the second plural present is borrowed from Bāgṛī .
The syllable gō is someṭimes added to the present , like the gā of Panjābī .
Thus , sai-gō , he is , corresponding to the Panjābī hai-gā In other respects verbs are conjugated as in Mēwātī .
Elsewhere they are gradually being Hinduized , and there is , at the same time , a distinct tendency among them to abandon their old dialect in favour of Khas .
A corrected and enlarged reprint is found in B .H .Hodgson ’ s Essays on the Languages , Literature , and Religion of Nepăl and Tibet .
Beames , J ., Outlines of Indian Philology , with a map showing the distribution of Indian languages .
Appendix A contains numerals in Gurung , etc.
Hunter , W.W., A Comparative Dictionary of the Languages of India and High Asia .
In vocabulary and phonetical system , and also in grammatical principles , Gurung is more closely related to Tibetan than are most Himalayan languages .
It is often difficult to decide whether a vowel is long or short , the spelling of the specimens being inconsistent .
It seems probable that Gurung in this respect agrees with Central Tibetan .
The consonantal system is apparently nearly the same as in Aryan dialects such as Hindī .
The aspirated soft consonants have apparently developed from older unaspirated sounds .
The final consonants of classical Tibetan have usually been dropped .
There are several compound consonants such as ghr , kr ; bhr , pr ; ghl , kl ; bhl , pl ; mr ; mn , and so on .
Tones and accent are probably the same as in other Nepal languages .
The numeral ghrī , one , is used as an indefinite article ; thus , mhī ghrī , a man .
The prefix a : is common before nouns of relationship .
The natural gender is distinguished by using different words or else by adding suffixes such as bokya , dho , dārhyā , male ; mama , me , murli , female .
There are two numbers , the singular and the plural .
The plural is not marked when it appears from the context .
Forms such as kõ-ye , clothes ; ma-ye , kisses , perhaps contain another plural suffix ye .
