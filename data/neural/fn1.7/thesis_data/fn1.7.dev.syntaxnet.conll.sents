Imperative .
According to the list of words the root alone , without any suffix , may be used as an imperative ; thus , kal , go ; chāng , be .
The usual suffixes are rō or ra^ and rang ; thus , pē-rō , give ; tleng-rang , bring .
The form ending in rang seems to be connected with the future suffix rāng in Rāngkhol , Hallām , etc.
The suffix of the negative imperative is māk-ro ; thus , nāo-w-in rūat-māk-ro , sons-among don ’ t consider , lit .
Compare the Old Kuki negative māk , and Introduction , p .19 .
The root alone is also used as an Infinitive or Verbal noun ; thus , nāo-w-in rūat māk-ro , sons among to consider cease ; ā-nāo-klēng chūng-ā , his brother ’ s arriving at .
The suffix of the Infinitive of purpose seems to be ding ; thus , ēi-ding ā-nāi-lo , eating for he got not , he got nothing to eat .
This form is also used as a verbal noun .
Other infinitive suffixes occur in the list of words ; thus , chāng-chē-la , to be ; jel-tā , to strike .
Both these forms seem to belong to the present definite or imperfect .
The mere root may be considered as a Relative participle in clauses such as ēi-ding ā-nāi-lo-hūn-in , to-eat he not-having time at , when he had nothing to eat .
Compare Verbal noun above .
The most usual suffix of this participle is nā ; thus , ā kal-nā rūm-chū , he going country that , that country into which he went .
As in Banjōgī , a suffix mi seems also to be used to form relative participles ; thus , kā nāo ān-tlao-mi kā-tong , my son who was lost has been found .
Conjunctive participles seem to be formed by means of the suffixes ā , ēn , and lā .
A Noun of agency is formed by adding the suffix tū ; thus , la^-lo-tū , a cultivator ; kēl-kāl-tū , a goat tender , a shepherd ; mā-vāi-tū , one who wastes .
There is no Passive voice .
Compound verbs are formed by means of prefixes and by adding other words in order to modify the meaning .
The prefix hong denotes motion towards the speaker ; thus , hong-choy-rang , here-bring .
Instead of ni-rot we find rūat ( compare Lushēi ruat ) in the corresponding passage , and ni is perhaps the pronominal prefix of the second person singular .
The prefix mā seems to have a transitive force ; thus , mā-tim , to kiss ; mā-riem , to give a feast ( compare mi riem-ti , they feasting ) .
Van in van-tlang-hong-rang , come let us be merry , is perhaps connected with the emphasising prefix vūn in Lai .
Causatives are formed by adding pūi , probably identical with Lushēi pui , to help , to assist ; thus ā kal-pūi , he brought ; zū nā in-pūi , beer thou causest to be drunk .
The Negative particle is lo ; thus ā-nāi-lo , he had not .
A negative prefix m seems to occur in mhi mhi , no , i.e., m ’ hi , it is not .
The regular Order of words seems to be subject , direct object , indirect object , verb .
Name of the language .
The name Korwā does not therefore appear to have anything to do with that word , which in the west has the form kōṛ It is perhaps connected with names such as Kherwāṛ We do not , however , know anything about the original meaning of either of those words .
In the case of Manbhum this agrees with information kindly supplied by the Rev .
DialectṣThe language of the Korwās is not the same in all places .
Specimens of that more refined form of the language will be given below on pp .
There are no corresponding returns in the caste table , and it is therefore probable that the language figures are due to some misunderstanding .
Crooke , W., A Vocabulary of the Korwa Language .
They are , however , the only foundation for the remarks on Korwā grammar which follow .
The semi-consonants have only been marked in the Jashpur specimens , and even there in a very inconsistent manner .
Note also the insertion of a w in forms such as katā-waḍ-i-ā , he said to him ; the use of the infix n in words such as anamak ’ , thy ; kanalom , last year , etc.
; and the common tendency to change the semi-consonant t ’ in verbal forms to ḍ , r .and r .Compare kasūr-teḍ-ā-ing , I sinned ( Jashpur ) ; yam-keṛ-ā , got ( Palamau ) ; katā-ter-ā , said ( Palamau ) .
Verbal tenses in the Jashpur specimens frequently end in ō ; thus , āyum-aḍ-ō , he heard ; but katā-waḍ-ā , he said ; katā-ter-ā-yō , he said .
It is impossible to decide whether this ō is a suffixed particle or represents a change of ā or e to ō .
Nouns .
The inflexion of nouns is , mainly speaking , regular .
Numerals .
The numerals ‘ four ’ and following are borrowed .
Pronouns .
The personal pronouns are apparently regular .
In the case of demonstrative pronouns we find the same forms beginning with m as in Asurī .
An initial y does not appear to belong to the Muṇḍā languages .
Verbs .
The verb substantive is īdān , past doho-tan , as in Asurī .
The indefinite future tense is regularly formed .
The usual present tense is formed as in Muṇḍārī .
The suffix tā in Jashpur sometimes also has the meaning of past time ; thus , doho-tā , was ; bol-tā , entered .
The various stages of past time are denoted by means of the same suffixes as in Santālī and Muṇḍārī , though we cannot , of course , expect to find instances of all the various forms in use in those languages .
In the first place we have the simple past formed by adding the suffixes eḍ , aḍ , en ( yān ) , an .
Such forms frequently have the meaning of a present ; thus , goj-yan-ā , I die ; im-yad-ā , he gives ; chalāo-en-ā , goes .
The Muṇḍārī suffix tet ’ occurs as ted , teḍ , teṛ , and ter .
The suffix ket ’ , ken , etc., occurs in forms such as byāh-ked-e-ā , he has married her ; īdān-kī-ā , said ; yam-keṛ-ā , got ; surtā-ker-ā , he came to his senses ; goch ’ - ken-ā , he died ; vich ’ - ken-ā , he has come , and so forth .
Forms such as tilā-gad-ā , I have taken ; ñam-gaḍ-ō , he got , and so forth , apparently contain the suffix kat ’ .
The remoter past is formed by adding the suffixes let ’ , len , etc.
The imperative is regular .
The noun of agency is formed as in Asurī .
The negative particle is mē in Jashpur , minē in Mirzapur , and menē or nē in Palamau .
A list of Standard Words and Phrases from Mirzapur will be found below on pp .
The remarks on Digāru grammar which follow are based on this sketch and on the list of words published by Mr.Needham .
The most usual prefixes are mā and nā , often abbreviated to m and n , perhaps corresponding to the prefixes ma and n which form nouns and adjectives in Kachin .
Nā is usually prefixed to nouns denoting relationship .
This nā is perhaps originally the possessive pronoun of the second person .
A prefix kā seems to occur in words such as kā-lō , field ; kā-rā , rain ; kā-chī , rat ; kā-nō-ā , dark ; kā-rō , quickly .
Compare the prefix ka or ga in the Kachin , Bodo , and Nāgā languages .
The prefix ā or a occurs in words such as ā-lī , bow ; ā-prü , arm ; ā-rui , snow ; a-shā , mithon , etc.
Gender is only apparent in the case of animate nouns .
The gender of human beings is distinguished by using different words .
Compare the male suffix wa in Kachin .
The usual suffixes in the case of animals are kārī ( Needham ) or karu : ( Robinson ) , male , and tāpī ( Needham ) or tassi ( Robinson ) , female .
Other suffixes are rī~ , male , and krū , female ; thus , tāmyūm rī~ , a male monkey ; tāmyūm krū , a female monkey .
When it is necessary to distinguish the number of a noun , a numeral or some word meaning ‘ all , ’ ‘ many , ’ etc., is added .
The nominative and the accusative do not take any suffix .
The genitive is expressed by putting the governed before the governing word ; thus , mā-jī rō , the buffalo ’ s horn .
Other relations are indicated by means of postpositions such as kwa or kõ , in ; do or dõ , with ; kō and tappe , from , etc.
Adjectives follow the noun they qualify .
There are no suffixes of the comparative .
Mr.Robinson mentions that the adjective may get a prolonged or shortened pronunciation in order to denote a high or low degree .
They follow the noun they qualify .
The numbers 11-19 are formed by adding the numerals ‘ one , ’ ‘ two , ’ etc., to ‘ ten ; ’ thus , hālü , or hālong , khing , ten one , eleven ; hālu : sāng or halo ra-chong , thirteen , etc.
The numerals 20-90 are formed by prefixing ‘ two , ’ ‘ three , ’ etc., to hā-lāng , ten .
The plural is , according to Mr.Robinson , formed by adding long , before which hā becomes hing .
Compare the corresponding suffix lu in Miri and Daflā .
The possessive pronouns are the same as the personal ones .
The demonstrative pronouns are ē-chā or e-sā this , and wē-chā or hi-sā , that .
The interrogative pronouns are shā ( Needham ) or sā-hā ( Robinson ) , who ?
There are no relative pronouns .
It seems that they are usually formed after the pattern ‘ I saw a man , he has come , ’ instead of ‘ the man whom I saw has come ’ .
Verbs do not vary for gender , number , or person .
The Present tense is formed without any suffix .
The verb dī , to sit , to be , is sometimes suffixed as a kind of auxiliary verb .
The suffixed mam in the last instance is an affirmative particle and no tense suffix .
The suffix of the Past tense is yā ( Needbam ) or a ( Robinson ) .
The suffix of the Future is n-dē .
Compare the suffix na in Southern Kachin .
The suffix of the Imperative is nā .
An imperative of the first person plural is formed by adding kē or gē ; thus , pō-kē or pō-gē , let us go ; dh ā~-kē or dh ā~-gē , let us eat ; yī-kē or yī-ge , let us stay .
Compare Infinitive of purpose , and also the suffix gē of the negative future in Miri .
The suffix of the negative imperative is gā , to which ī is usually prefixed .
The root alone is used as a verbal noun .
Bri-no may as well , in this instance , be considered as a compound verb .
Mr.Robinson mentions a suffix gē which is used in order to denote purpose .
It will be seen from this instance that the suffix gē is a suffix of the future , that tense being used to denote the purpose in Digāru as in other connected languages .
Bhē in hā~ tā-pē~ dh ā~-dī-bhē , I cooked rice eat-if , is perhaps the suffix of an adverbial participle .
Compound verbs seem to be formed by simply putting two verbs together .
They are perhaps formed by suffixing gō ( Needham ) or kwon ( Robinson ) .
Desideratives seem to be formed by adding no ; thus , according to Mr.Robinson , hā teku bri-no , I paddy to-buy-wish .
Potentiality is indicated by adding hēnē ( Needham ) or hanē ( Robinson ) .
The Negative particle is a suffixed im ( Needham ) or yem , yom ( Robinson ) .
Mr.Robinson states that lum is added in the negative future and in the potential mood .
Both forms are apparently future tenses , all Mr.Robinson ’ s instances of the potential mood being in the future .
There is , therefore , probably a future suffix la , or lu , which is used before the negative .
The usual tense suffixes are sometimes dropped before the negative .
The Interrogative particle is gē .
The interrogative particle seems to be dropped when the sentence contains an interrogative pronoun .
The usual order of words is subject , object , verb .
There is a tendency to aspirate consonants , as in mōṭhō , for mōṭö , great ; ēkhāḍī , for ēkāḍī , a certain one ; chhumō for chumō , kissed ; ā~ghē or ā~gē , before .
The vowel scale is indefinite .
A final ē is often weakened to a , as in chha for chhē , he is ; na or nē , to ; ra or rē , the locative of rō , of .
The declension of nouns is very irregular .
No doubt all strong nouns of a basis originally had their nominatives singular in ō , with an oblique form in ā .
Thus , ghōḍō , a horse ; oblique form ghōḍā .
But the Labhānās in the course of their wanderings have also picked up the Hindōstānī idiom of making these nouns have their nominatives in ā , with an oblique form in ē .
Thus , ghōḍā , a horse ; oblique form ghōḍē .
We meet the same word sometimes with one termination and sometimes with the other , and there is absolutely no rule on the subject .
Many nouns , even those ending in consonants , have an oblique form in ē .
The plural of nouns in ō or ā ends in ā or ē .
Thus bēṭō , a son , plural bēṭā ; bēṭā , a son , plural bēṭē .
Examples of the plural of feminine nouns are bīr , a woman , plural bīrē ; bēṭī , a daughter , plural bēṭīyā .
Other nouns form their plural as in Western Rājasthānī .
For the various cases we have the following postpositions .
For the agent , we have nē , often weakened to na , as in ō-nē , by him ; jē-na , by whom .
The use of the agent case is , however , rare .
More usually the nominative is used , and governs transitive verbs just as if they were intransitives .
As an example of the agent case , we have ō-nē mēlyō , he sent .
For the dative-accusative we have the usual locatives of the genitive postpositions .
The suffix of the ablative is usually tī as in waḍhāḷ-paṇē-tī , by debauchery .
The suffix of the genitive is usually rō .
Rō has its oblique masculine rā , its feminine rī , and its locative ( agreeing with nouns in the locative and dative ) rē , as in Mārwāṛī .
The usual sign of the locative is mē , ma , or mā .
The sense of gender is very capricious .
Adjectives follow the Mārwāṛī rules .
They are put in the locative in ē to agree with a noun in that case .
Pronouns .
The pronouns of the first and second person make no distinction between the nominative and the agent cases .
For Demonstrative pronouns ( including the pronoun of the third person , we have ū , ō , he , that , they ; ō-nē , by him ( but ū kyō , he said ) ; ō-rō , his ; ō-rē , ō-na , to him ; ānu-rō or anu-rō , their .
Conjugation .
The present tense of the verb substantive closely follows colloquial Gujarātī .
It will be observed that , as in some forms of colloquial Gujarātī , chha may be used for all persons and both numbers .
The past is vētō .
When used as an auxiliary it becomes simply tō , as in colloquial Gujarātī .
As for Finite verbs , the Infinitive , Present Participle , and Past Participle are as in Rājasthānī , viż , mārᵃnō , to strike ; mārᵃtō , striking ; māryō , struck .
In the past participle , however , the y is often omitted , so that we also have mārō .
The simple present is conjugated much like the corresponding tense in Gujarātī and Rājasthānī .
The present definite is also conjugated as in these languages , the auxiliary verb being added to the simple present , and not to the present participle .
Other examples are ( often with the sense of a future ) marūchhū , I die ; khāū-chha , we may eat ; hōū-chha , let us become .
The Past tense is as usual , except that this tense in the case of transitive verbs agrees with the subject .
In the former case , the auxiliary verb agrees with the subject .
The Future is mainly based on the h-future of Mārwāṛī .
It is conjugated as follows .
Irregular Past Participles are khādō , eaten ; kidō , done ; dinō or dēnō , given ; lābhō , got ; kyō , kēwō , or kēhō , said ; ryō , remained ; gyō or gō , gone .
In vēlā paḍ-gē , want fell , gē seems to be used as a feminine instead of gī .
The conjunctive participle is formed by adding an to the root .
A sort of continuous conjunctive participle is formed by adding tānī ( for thānē , having become , as we see from the Central Provinces specimens ) to the root , as in rē-tānī , while remaining ; dē-tānī , while giving .
The Rājasthānī idiom of employing kō-nī , at-all not , for the negative is very common .
The majority of the inhabitants of the Chamba State speak Aryan dialects .
There are , besides , some speakers of Tibetan and of a dialect which is almost identical with Manchāṭī .
T.Grahame Bailey has written a full account of the dialect which he proposes to call Chamba Lāhuḷī .
Articles .
The numeral ī , one , is used as an indefinite article ; thus , ī miū~ , of a man ; ī sāhūkārē , a money lender .
Nouns .
The inflexion of nouns is in most particulars the same as in Manchāṭī .
Gender .
The natural gender is distinguished in the usual way ; thus , bā , father ; yā , mother : rhiz , male goat ; lā , female goat : taṛ-bhīṛ , male cat ; bhīṛ , female cat : ts hāh , horse ; nab-rhā~ , mare .
Number .
There are two numbers , the singular and plural .
The plural is not expressed when it appears from the context ; thus , hāthī , elephant , and elephants .
The usual plural suffix is r ; thus , rhī~ , sister ; rhī~-r , sisters : mīl-yō , daughter ; mīl-yōr , daughters .
Case .
The cases of the singular and of the plural differ in the same way as in Manchāṭī .
The subject of intransitive verbs and the object are not distinguished by adding suffixes .
The subject of transitive verbs , on the other hand , is put in the case of the agent , which is said to be formed by adding ts or , after vowels , ē in the singular and z in the plural ; thus , rhā~- ts , by a horse ; bā-ē , by a father ; mīl-yō-ē , by a daughter ; rh ānez , by the horses ; mīl-yō-z , by the daughters , sū~ra-z , by the swine .
The suffix of the dative is vi or bi ; plural dī ; thus , rhī~-vi and rhī~-bi , to a sister ; rhāne-dī , to horses ; mīl-yō-dī , to daughters .
The suffix of the genitive is u or ō , plural du ; thus , rhã-u , of a horse ; bā-ō , of a father ; mīū~ , of a man ( mī~ , man ) ; mīl-yō-du , of daughters .
The genitive can also be expressed by putting the governed before the governing noun , without any suffix ; thus , hāthī , of an elephant ; sā~sī rhān palānz , the white horse ’ s saddle .
The final n of rhān is probably developed from the nasal sound in rhā~ , horse .
The ablative is formed by adding do ts , i.e., dor- ts therefrom , to the base or to the genitive ; thus , rhā~-do ts , from a horse ; bā-ō do ts , from a father .
Do ts is by origin an ablative of the demonstrative pronoun du , do , and the actual suffix is ts as in the case of the agent .
A terminative and locative are formed by adding rī , arī ; thus , konz arī , on the foot ; nōkararī , to the servants ; rhī-rī , in the field .
A shorter suffix r occurs in dē-r , here ; du-r , there , etc.
It is perhaps connected with rā , plural da in nu-rā , on that side , dī-rā , on this side ; gē-rā sādē , with me ; rhī~-rā sādē , with his sister ; yāra-da sādē , with my friends .
Other relations are indicated by means of postpositions .
Adjectives .
Adjectives precede the word they qualify ; thus , sāsī rhā~ , the white horse .
The particle of comparison is vē ; thus , rhī~ vē mōrē , sister than big , bigger than the sister .
Numerals .
The first numerals are given in the list of words .
Other numerals are sē-īdī , eleven , sha-shrum , thirteen ; sā-pī , fourteen ; sang , fifteen ; sā-trūī , sixteen ; sā-nhī , seventeen ; sā-rē , eighteen , sos-kū , nineteen .
Higher numbers are counted in twenties .
Ordinals are formed by adding mī ; thus , tū-mī , first ; juṛ-mī , second ; shrum-mī , third .
Pronouns .
The following are the personal pronouns : Note also ēnō , own .
A .H .Francke informs me that there are also dual forms of the pronouns , and , moreover , both exclusive and inclusive forms of the dual and plural of the first person .
Demonstrative pronouns are di , this ; du , that , and nu , that ( compare nuar , there ; nu-rā , on that side , etc.) .
Note dō dēshā-rī , in that country , where the demonstrative precedes the qualified noun in the genitive .
Interrogative and indefinite pronouns are ārī , who ?
The interrogative pronouns can also be used as relatives ; thus , aũ ghārī chumh kachā pī , what time house near came , when he approached the house ; anyō māl gē-bī pīpā gē-bī raũ , how-much property me-to comes me-to give , give me the property that falls to me .
Verbs .
The conjugation of verbs is the same as in Manchāṭī .
The pronominal suffixes added in order to distinguish the person of the subject are g , k , ga , or nothing for the first ; n and na for the second ; d , dō , or nothing for the third person singular ; ni for the first and second , and r for the third person plural .
Verb substantive .
The usual bases of the verb substantive are shu and to or ta .
Forms such as tod tōī are also used in the plural .
Forms such as todoni , tadoni , we are , are compounds containing the base to , ta , and an auxiliary do which is probably originally identical .
Finite verb .
The verb substantive plays a considerable rôle in the formation of the various tenses of finite verbs .
Present time .
The present tense is formed by adding dō , d , followed by the personal suffixes to the base or to a participle ending in pā , bā , ā , etc.
Forms such as ra-mā-d , he gives , show that the third person singular is formed by adding the personal suffix directly to the participle ; compare also pī-pā , comes ; brā~ , lives .
The latter form is identical with the base .
The participles used in the formation of the present tense can also be described as verbal nouns .
Past time .
A simple past is formed by adding ī and subjoining the personal suffixes ; thus , kū-ī-g , I said ; thā-ī-n , thou heardest ; thā-ī-ni , we , you heard .
The suffix i often coalesces with a preceding vowel in various ways ; thus , pī-g , I came ; rē~ , he gave ; lhē-r , they did ; lhē-na and lhē-n , didst .
The termination of the third person is rī , plural ra , after s-sounds ; thus , khos-ī-rī , he was found ; khos-ī-re , they were found ; roshēshī-rī , he got angry .
A compound past is formed by adding do , da ; to , ta to the base and conjugating throughout ; thus , shu-tō , I became ; shu-ton , becamest ; shu-tō ; became ; shutoni , we , you , became ; shutor , they became ; zē-da , I ate ; zē-dan , atest ; zē-dō , ate ; zē-dani , we , you , ate ; zē-dor , they ate .
The most common past tense is apparently formed by adding deg ( teg ) , etc., to the base or to a verbal noun ending in ā , pā , bā , mā , zā , ts ā , etc.
Deg is by origin a past tense of the base da , which is used as a verb substantive .
An l-suffix occurs in forms such as ī-leā , ī-lead , and ī-lī , he went ; thā-le-g , I heard , and so on .
It perhaps belongs to the base .
Future .
The future is formed by adding o to the base or to the verbal noun ending in ā , etc.
The suffix of the third person singular is dō or du .
Imperative .
The imperative is formed by adding ō , u ; thus , raũ , give ; lhaō , do ; keō , leave .
A suffix do : is used instead in ādöh , come ; hādö , bring .
The base alone is apparently used in īl , go .
The verbal noun ending in pa , etc., can also be used as an imperative ; thus , dāpa , fall .
A plural imperative is formed by adding ni or ăni ; thus , ādani , come ye ; īlani , go ye .
Zauani , let us eat , is a future .
The negative imperative is formed by prefixing tha or by suffixing tha , plural thō ; thus , tha lō , do not do ; dau tha , fall not ; dāpeni thō , fall not ye .
Verbal nouns and participles .
The base alone is used as a verbal noun ; thus , drō rē~ , running gave , he ran ; kē~ zē tadan , thee-by eating is-by-thee , thou hast to eat .
A common verbal noun is formed by adding ā , pā , bā , mā , zā , ṛā , etc.
The same suffix is apparently used to form relative participles and nouns of agency ; thus , kam-lhā-zā , work doer , servant ; khosā , found .
If the final ā is replaced by ī the meaning is apparently that of an infinite of purpose ; thus , gī i-bī tō-ig , by-me to-go was-I , I had to go ; kuṛi-mī , to say ; ruā- ts ī , in order to feed , etc.
Compare the suffixes of the case of the agent and of the terminative .
Negative verb .
The negative particle is a prefixed ma ; thus , ma ramā-der , they did not give ; ma da-g , I shall not fall .
Ma sometimes coalesces with a following vowel ; thus , mēh-g , I shall not go .
It is sometimes also suffixed ; thus , thuāsī ma , did not neglect .
The past negative tenses of ābī , to come ; ībī , to go , are formed as follows .
The negative is , in such forms , a suffix .
It will be seen that the plural forms of the third person are dual by origin .
The pronouns of the third person are also used as demonstratives ; thus , kōō , this ; mōō , that , etc.
Interrogative pronouns are āsā and āsā-lo , who ?
The same bases occur in the indefinite pronouns āsā-ne , anybody ; ūkhāng , anything .
Verbs .
We are very unsatisfactorily informed about the use of pronominal suffixes in order to denote the person and number of the subject and object and about the formation of tenses .
A dual and a plural subject of the second person with an imperative are indicated by adding chi , nin , respectively ; thus , cho , eat ; cha-chi , eat ye two ; cha-nin , eat ye .
An object of the first person singular is indicated by adding the suffix ngā in pi-ngā , give me .
The t in pi-t-tu , give him , is perhaps a corresponding suffix of the third person .
The form henge , it is , yes , seem s to show that a suffix e is used to form a present .
The base alone can be used as an imperative ; thus , nā , take ; yēpok , stand up .
Other imperatives end in o and u or a ; thus , dūngo , drink ; lomu , strike ; dāba , come .
The suffix o or u is changed to a before the suffixes chi and nin of the dual and plural ; thus , dūngo , drink ; dūnga-nin , drink ye .
There is apparently a negative suffix ne ; thus , hē-nga-ne , it is not , no .
An infix ni occurs in words such as nū-ni-ne , good not , bad .
In mā-tūpti , not ripe , raw , we apparently have a prefix mā .
The negative with imperatives is a prefixed na .
Nouns .
The prefix ūm in ūm-pā , father ; ūm-dhābmi , husband ; ūm-lēpa , day , and so on , is by origin a demonstrative pronoun ; compare ūm , his , her , its .
Gender is distinguished by using different terms , or else by adding suffixes or words indicating the sex .
There are three numbers , the singular , the dual , and the plural .
The suffix chī , which appears to be a dual suffix , is also added in the plural ; thus , ūmmā māni-mā-chī , female cats .
The genitive is expressed by putting the governed before the governing word without any suffix ; thus , pich-chhā , cow ’ s young , calf .
The suffix mi , mu , can be added ; thus , tā-mu sām , head-of hair .
It is by origin a demonstrative pronoun ; compare Bāhing mi .
Other relations are indicated by means of postpositions .
Numerals .
The first numerals are given in the table on p .342 .
Pronouns .
The following are the personal pronouns : The from meko-chi , they , is by origin a dual .
The suffix mi can be added to the genitive of all pronouns ; thus , ang-kā-mi , mine and theirs .
The pronouns of the third person are also used as demonstrative pronouns ; thus , moko and moko-ngā , that .
The nearer demonstrative is noko or noko-ngā , this .
Interrogative pronouns are āsā and āsāle , who ?
The indefinite particle is sāng , also ; thus , āsā-sāng , anybody ; yõ-sāng , anything .
Verbs .
We are very unsatisfactorily informed about the use of pronominal suffixes in order to denote the person and number of the subject and object , and about the formation of tenses .
The suffixes chu , or chi , num or ni , respectively , are added to an imperative in order to denote a subject of the second person dual and plural , respectively .
The suffix ān , i.e.
probably ā~ , is used to indicate an object of the first person singular in pī-ān , give me .
The forms yē , in-chhūng and in-ngā , it is , yes , seem to show that the base alone , and with one of the suffixes chhūng and ngā , can be used as a present .
The mere base is also used as an imperative ; thus , nē , take ; mō , do .
Other imperatives are formed by adding ō , ū , and ā ; thus , chō , eat ; dūng-ū , drink ; yosu , strike ; ipsā sleep ; bānā , come , etc.
We do not know anything about the meaning of the consonants preceding the final vowel of such imperatives .
The negative particle is a prefixed mā or man ; thus , mā-nā , not-is , no ; man-duwako , not ripe , raw .
Hodgson also mentions a negative suffix īsi .
The negative with imperatives is na .
Nouns .
The prefix ūm in ūm ’ pā , faher ; ūm ’ mā , mother , etc., is identical with the pronoun ūm , his , her , its .
Gender is distinguished by using different words or by adding suffixes or words such as ūm ’ pā , umprūpa , male ; ūm ’ mā , ummrūma , female .
There are three numbers , the singular , the dual , and the plural .
The suffix chi is said to be used both in the dual and in the plural ; thus , mik ’ , eye , dual and plural mi ’ chi .
In the case of adjectives we find a dual suffix chia and a separate plural suffix miha ; thus , nūyē , good , dual nuk-chia , plural nuk-miha .
The genitive is expressed by putting the governed before the governing word without any suffix ; thus , pi ’ pasā , cow ’ s young , calf .
If the governing word is understood , the suffix mi is added ; thus , kāngā-mi , mine .
Numerals .
The first numerals are given in the table on p .342 .
The forms ending in pang , bang , are used when the qualified noun denotes male or female 
I regret that up to the time of writing I have not succeeded in obtaining any specimens of this language .
Their language differs from village to village , but this is principally a matter of intonation and pronunciation .
As a whole the language has no marked dialects , though it might be equally true to say that every village has its own dialect .
Lhōtā is a distinct language from Āo , but is at the same time closely connected with it .
We may therefore class these Nāgā languages as a great tree with at least two boughs , one represented by Āo and Lhōtā , and the other by Angāmi , Rengmā , Kezhāmā , and Semā .
W.E., Outline Grammar of the Lhōtā Nāgā Language ; with a Vocabulary and Illustrative Sentences .
Lhōtā Nāgā , unlike Āo , abounds in aspirated consonants .
Tones play an important part in Lhōtā .
At present there is no information available concerning them except that the syllable of negation is always pronounced on a much higher key than the rest of the word to which it is prefixed .
The voice always falls at the end of a sentence , and in double interrogatives , in which the verbal root is reduplicated , the first syllable of the interrogative verb is spoken on a much higher key than the rest of the sentence .
Prefixes and Suffixes .
In addition to prefixes used to make forms corresponding to declension and conjugation , the following should be noted .
Nearly every noun takes the prefix ō , which is again dropped when a possessive or other modifying word unites with it to form a word of two or more syllables .
This prefix corresponds to the prefix ā which is met in Semā , Rengmā , and Mongsen Āo , and to the Kezhāmā e.The prefix e , corresponding to the te or t of Āo , is used before nouns , adjectives , and gerunds , has no formative significance , and may be assumed or thrown off at pleasure .
Examples of this prefix will be found below .
Nouns of agency are formed by the suffix e~ , with or without the prefix e.Thus , shisho , to trade , shishoe~ , a trader ; vü , to sew , e-vü-e~ , a tailor .
Another suffix having a similar force is wōchī or mōchī .
This corresponds to the Āo suffix er , and the Angāmi suffix u .
This suffix , which corresponds to the relative particle of Dravidian languages , is of frequent occurrence .
Mr.Witter gives the following excellent example of the way in which nouns , adjectives , and verbs are in their root forms indistinguishable from one another .
The force of the indefinite article is conveyed by suffixing the indefinite pronouns matsangā or ntsangā , a certain .
The numeral e-khā , one , is only used in counting , and not as an article .
The force of the definite articles is given by suffixing the demonstrative pronouns shī , this , or chī , that .
More often , however , the relative particle wōchī , or wōchu : is suffixed .
These articles are only used when ambiguity would result from their absence .
For human relations , different words are used to indicate gender .
Number is only indicated when this is rendered necessary by the context .
In this case , the indefinite article is used to indicate the singular , and , usually , the plurals of the demonstrative proncuns , shī-āng , chī-āng , etc., to denote the plural .
There is no plural suffix corresponding to the Āo tam .
Nouns of multitude are # so added to form the plural .
Also the suffix dī , as in korr-dī , horses .
There is a rudimentary dual , as in Āo and Angāmi .
The syllable tō is frequently suffixed when two or more objects are spoken of in succession .
Case is indicated by postpositions .
The sign of the nominative , when it is the subject of a transitive verb , is nā .
When there are two or more nominatives to the same verb , the nā is only suffixed to the last .
This nā is evidently the sign of the case of the Agent , and the literal translation of the foregoing sentence is ‘ by your brother and my brother a tiger was slain ’ .
The suffix corresponds to the Kezhāmā nyi .
When the nominative is the subject of an intransitive verb it either takes the suffix , cho , or has no suffix at all .
The accusative case takes no suffix .
When a verb has also an indirect object , it stands between the direct object and the verb .
This case is formed by the suffix nā , as in ā-nā ō-nung-nā shī e-phīā-tsang-cho , I slew him with a stone .
Dative .
The suffixes are ī , thenī and thingī , to , and o , etchī , etchu : and etsconā , for .
Ablative .
The suffix is nā , as in ā kī-nā rō-chō , I came from my house .
The suffixes are ī , in ; o or lo , on ; and we or wī , in the direction of , on , upon ; or other postpositions may be used .
When a noun is followed by an adjective in agreement with it , the postposition is added to the latter .
Adjectives .
Adjectives usually , but not always , follow the nouns they qualify The suffix wōchī , or one of its varieties , is very commonly used with adjectives , as in the example just given .
Comparison is indicated by suffixing wō , gone , to the adjective .
The suffix is liable to be euphonically changed to mō or ō .
The numerals will be found in the list of words .
The following ordinals are given by Mr.Witter : ovūngōchü , the one in front , first .
The Personal pronouns are Nom .
The Demonstrative pronouns are used for the third person .
The Possessive pronouns are as illustrated below .
The Demonstrative pronouns , both of which are used as pronouns of the third person , are , 1 .shī , hī , this , he ; shī tō ōnī , these two ; shīāng , shīā~ , shīānō , hīang , these , they .
The Interrogative pronouns are ō-chī , ō-chō , who ?
The force of the Relative pronoun is usually given by the relative suffix wōchī , etc., he who is .
Sometimes the interrogative pronoun is used as a relative , and is then followed by a demonstrative .
The Reflexive pronoun is mōchī or mōmō , self .
The ideas of time and mood are conveyed by prefixes and suffixes added to the root .
The verb does not change for number or person .
The use of the prefix e has already been referred to .
The following are the principal tenses of the verb tsō , eat : Present .
Present definite .
Same as second form of present , ā-nā tsō-ā-lā , I was eating .
Past .
Future .
Imperative .
Participles and Gerunds .
The same form sometimes has the power of an-adjective , i.e., participle , and sometimes that of a verbal noun , i.e., gerund .
Classifying them according to time referred to , we have the following suffixes and prefixes : 
The past conditional is formed with wō in the protasis , and kàtōlā in the apodosis .
Compound verbs .
As in Āo , a large number of particles can be added to a root in order to modify its meaning .
There are also prefixes used with a similar result .
Passive voice .
As in Āo , roots may be used either in an active or in a passive signification .
Negative forms are indicated by the prefix n or m , except in the imperative mood , where it is tī .
The negative prefixes are pronounced as separate syllables , and always in a higher key than the rest of the word .
The Interrogative particles are ke and nung , which are attached to the verb .
Double interrogatives double the verbal root , and , in the past tense , take the termination ēlā .
Adjectives and articles usually follow the nouns they qualify .
The thing possessed follows the possessor .
