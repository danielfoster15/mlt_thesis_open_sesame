The subject of intransitive verbs and the object are not distinguished by adding any separate suffix .
The subject of transitive verbs is put in the case of the agent , which is formed by adding a suffix ji or di ; thus , ā-ba-di bī-dī , the father said ; ki-ji hoā-ji , thou struckest .
This suffix is sometimes also written de , and in that case it looks like the postposition de~ or de , classical Tibetan dang , with which , in its turn , is sometimes written di .
The initial d of the suffix of the agent is often pronounced as a th .
In chhu-ba-si , with ropes , the instrument has been indicated by adding a suffix si .
The suffix of the dative is lā-di or lāi ; thus , ā-ba-lādi , to a father .
Such forms are sometimes also used to denote the object of transitive verbs ; thus , cha-e jha-lā-di nga-di dhon-di , his son-to me-by struck , I have beaten his son .
The usual suffix of the genitive is e or ye ; thus , dhĩ-ye , of the house .
An a preceding the genitive suffix is often dropped ; thus ṭi-be ghlo-ri , living-of place-in , in the place where he stayed .
Another genitive suffix is la ; thus , ā-ba-mae-la , of fathers .
It is probably originally a dative suffix ; compare chiti-la , to senses .
The usual terminative-locative suffix is , however , rī or re ; thus , mno-rī , in the field , to the field .
The suffix na in forms such as pho-de-pho-de-na , with hunger ; rhe-gũ-na , from a distance ; saba-na , safely , is probably an ablative suffix .
Other relations are indicated by means of postpositions .
Adjectives usually follow the noun they qualify , or precede it in the genitive ; thus , mhi sa-ba , a good man ; the-be anikāl , a heavy famine .
Adjectives usually take the suffix ba ; thus , sa-ba , good ; sim-ba , cold ; kro-ba , hot ; mī-va , ripe .
The particle of comparison is bhandā ; thus , cha-ma-e ring bhandā cha-ma-e ā-lī nu-ba mu-lā , his sister than his brother tall is , his brother is taller than his sister .
The first numerals are given in the list of words .
They follow the word they qualify .
Higher numbers are counted in tens ; thus , bhlī-chyu , forty ; ṭu-chyu , sixty ; nī-chyu , seventy ; bhre-chyu , eighty ; ku-chyu , ninety .
The following are the personal pronouns : 
The final n in some of the forms just quoted is probably an intensifying particle .
Reflexive pronouns are khi-ye , own ; thama , thama-ye , thame , own .
Demonstrative pronouns are chu , this ; cha , that .
Interrogative pronouns are khae-pa-chā , who ?
The indefinite pronouns are formed from the same bases ; thus , khae-ba-de , by anybody ; tayī , anything , and , according to Hodgson , also sū-yāng , anybody ; ta-yāng , anything .
The two last mentioned pronouns contain an indefinite particle yā or yāng .
The conjugation of verbs is relatively simple .
There is no change for person or number , and the verb is , on the whole , still virtually a noun .
The most common verb substantive is mu .
Another base na is used in form such as tõ-si na-bu , am , art , or is , beating .
A third base is ta or tu in ta-di , is ; tũ-di , am ; tab-mu , shall be ; nga lāla tum-mu , I should be , and so forth .
The verb substantive is , to some extent , used in the conjugation of finite verbs .
The base alone is used as a present tense ; thus , nha-me jaga-di tõ , you strike .
M or ma , i.e., probably the verb substantive mu , is , however .
Forms such as chha-se-m , he is grazing ; ti-si-m , he lives ; kha-si-m , he comes , are formed by adding the same m to the conjunctive participle .
The suffix lā in mu-lā , is , was , is probably a general assertive suffix , and is not restricted with regard to time .
The suffix lā or lā~ is often used with the meaning of a past ; thus , nga hyā-lā , I went ; kha-lā~ , he came .
The suffix bā in la-bā , madest , is properly the suffix of a participle .
The most characteristic suffix of the past is ji or di ; thus , hoā-ji , went ; bī-di , said .
Forms such as la-sem , did ; ā-ngwe-sem , I did not transgress , seem to contain the conjunctive participle ending in si and the verb substantive .
The suffix of the future is mu , or ma , i.e., probably the verb substantive ; thus , ngai to-mu , I shall strike ; khi-ji hoā-ma , thou wilt strike .
The base alone is often used as an imperative .
A very common suffix is du , which often occurs in an abbreviated form d or t ; thus , cha-du , eat ; si-d , die ; rā-t , stand .
A verbal noun is formed by adding the suffix bā ; thus , nācha la-bā , dance making , dancing ; chha-ba-rī , in order to graze .
Forms such as cha-lā , to eat ; plī~-la , to fill , probably contain the same suffix as we have found in use in the formation of the tenses , or else la is a dative suffix .
The verbal noun ending in bā is also used as a relative participle , in which case it usually precedes the qualified noun in the genitive ; thus , dukha ta-be bela-ri , distress befalling time-at , at the time when distress befell him ; jāgīr cha-be mhi , wages eating man , servant .
The same participle is also used in such relative clauses as are introduced by an interrogative pronoun ; thus , nga-la to mu-ba , me-to what being , all that is mine .
The form ending in ba is sometimes also used with the meaning of a conjunctive participle ; thus , bī-ba , having said .
Another conjunctive participle is formed by adding the postposition mā to a verbal noun which is identical with the base ; thus , bī-mā , on saying , having said .
The tense bases are also used as participles ; thus , ti-sim mu-lā , is sitting ; sī-la , dead .
There is no passive voice .
It is formed by aspirating the initial consonant ; thus , cha-ba , to eat ; chha-ba , to feed .
The negative particle is a prefixed ā ; thus , ā-hyā , he did not go ; ā-pĩ , didst not give .
Na is sometimes added to the verb .
The usual order of words is subject , object , verb .
Numerals follow , and demonstrative pronouns and genitives precede the word they qualify .
For further details the student is referred to the version of the Parable of the Prodigal Son which follows and to the list of Standard Words and Phrases on pp .
At all events , we can safely assume that Rangkas is the form of speech used by Bhōṭiās all over Upper Johar and Upper Danpur .
Two specimens and a list of Standard Words and Phrases have been forwarded from the district .
Long and short vowels are often interchanged ; thus , jī and ji , I .
Similarly , the various vowels are often interchanged .
Compare ji , jē , jai-gō , my ; li-s , lē-s , and lai-s , said ; mī-s and mai-s , by a man ; sō , sū , sē , and s , the suffix of the case of the agent ; hvāsas and ka-hōsas , was lost ; rō , rī , ri , and r , the suffix of the terminative ; nyā and nē , the suffix of a conjunctive participle , and so forth .
In other cases it seems to denote a nasal pronunciation of the vowel ; thus , hū~ṭ , camel ; si-chãn , dying .
Hard and soft consonants are apparently very freely interchanged ; thus , g and k , the suffix of the genitive ; rā-ch and rā-j , came ; dhuk and ṭuk , all ; bhung-nyā and pun , tall .
S sometimes interchanges with ch ; thus in the suffix of past time .
We have no information regarding accentuation or tones .
Article .
Tā , a shorter form of the numeral tā-kā , one , and indefinite pronouns such as khamī , khami-rī , and khami-r , some ; gub , some , and gār , some , are used as indefinite articles ; thus , tā naukar , a servant ; khamī bā , a father ; khamir mī , a man ; gub rhã , a horse ; gār sã-khu , in a village .
Nouns .
There are no instances in the materials available of any suffixes or prefixes used in order to distinguish gender .
horse-woman , show that Rangkas in this respect agrees with other neighbouring forms of speech .
Number .
The plural is not distinguished by means of any suffix when it can be inferred from the context .
When required , a suffix chan , chã or chā appears to denote the plural ; thus , bē-chan , the bides ; khvi-chã , dogs ; bē-chā-k , of the skins .
In khamiri ni-chā~-k ( i.e., mī-chā~-k ) niśī sēri , one man-of two sons , the same suffix has apparently been used in order to form an honorific singular .
A kind of plural can also be effected by adding words such as titi , mhan , many , and so forth ; thus , bā titi , fathers ; mhan bā , fathers .
Case .
The various cases are apparently often interchanged .
Thus both the genitive and the dative are used as accusatives , the genitive also occurs with the function of a dative , and so forth .
The regular case system is apparently as follows .
The nominative and the accusative , i.e., the cases of the subject of intransitive verbs and of the object , are not distinguished by means of any suffix , although the genitive and the dative sometimes occur in the function of the object .
The subject of transitive verbs is usually put in the case of the agent , which is formed by adding the suffix sō , sū , sī , or s ; thus , bā-sō lē-s , father-by said , the father said ; nyāpan-su lī-s , small-by said , the younger said .
The same form is also used as an instrumental ; thus , chābuk-sō , with stripes .
The usual suffix of the dative is chabã or chubã , also written j-bãng and even j-chubã ; thus , bā-chubã , to the father ; bã-j-chubã , to the father ; u-j-bãng , to him .
In u-g khamiri-ś kharī ma dā-ś , his anyone-by anything not gave , no one gave him anything , the genitive has apparently been used instead of the dative , or else there is a dative suffix g , k.An ablative is formed by adding the suffix paṭṭī or baṭī .
The suffix of the genitive takes the forms gō , gu , g , and k ; thus , bā-gō , of the father ; mī-g , of a man .
So far as we can judge from the specimens , the terminative is commonly used as a locative .
It is formed by adding the suffix rō , rī , ri , or r ; thus , la-rō .
Other locative suffixes are su , sū , or similar forms , and khũ ; thus , khung-su , at the bottom ; sã-khũ , in the village .
Postpositions are sometimes added to the base and sometimes to the genitive .
Adjectives .
Adjectives precede the qualified noun in the nominative .
In nyāpan-sō sērī dhuk-chhan dū-nyā , the small-by son all gathering , the younger son having gathered all , the case suffix has been added to the adjective nyāpan and not , as we would expect , to the noun .
The particle of comparison is hvē ; thus , u pi-khan u rhangśyā hvē mhan mhan śini , his brother his sister from more tall is ; dukh hvē jhyān , all from good , best .
Numerals .
The first numerals are found in the list of words .
They precede the noun they qualify .
Pronouns .
The usual forms of the personal pronouns are as follows .
The Aryan loan-word apnō , apnō-gō , apnō-k , own , is used as a reflexive pronoun .
The pronoun u , ō , he , is sometimes used in order to repeat a preceding noun before postpositions or governing words .
Compare the corresponding use of pronominal prefixes in several Nepal dialects , in Kuki-Chin , and so on .
Demonstrative pronouns are i , idō , id , and ē , this ; hvē , hvēda , u , that .
The interrogative pronouns are formed from the bases kha , and gu .
By adding rī or r the interrogative bases are made indefinite .
Relative pronouns are jē , jai , jaid , jaidaś , jaidō , who ; jai-han-tā , whatever .
Verbs .
The list of Standard Words and Phrases contains a series of verbal forms which do not occur in the specimens .
On the whole , however , the conjugation in Rangkas is apparently less complicated than in the neighbouring dialects of Darma , Chaudangs and Byangs .
There is the same tendency to distinguish the person of the subject in the verb , especially in the case of the second person .
The past tense is sometimes formed by means of reduplication of the base , as is also the case in Chaudāngsī and Byāngsī .
Verb substantive .
The verb substantive is formed from the bases lhē , ni , and si .
The bases of the verb substantive are freely used in the formation of the various tenses of finite verbs .
Present time .
The specimens contain very few forms of the present .
In the first person singular we find the compound form sīchãn sis , I am dying ; and in the second person rhai-san , thou livest , occurs .
Both contain the verb substantive , rhai-sa-n also the suffix n of the second person .
It will be seen that there is here no suffix denoting the first person .
The third person singular is formed in various ways .
The base alone is sometimes used ; thus , ding , he falls .
In other cases the suffixes ni and t or d are added .
Past time .
The common suffix of past time is s or su ; thus , lī-s , he said ; gā-su , he made .
In the first person an i apparently precedes the s , and in the second person n , nau , nai , or nu is inserted .
Compound suffixes are sas , chas , and tas ; thus , rhū-sas , asked ; thō-chas , demanded ; gā-tas , made .
There are no instances of such forms in the first and second persons .
The s-suffixes are sometimes used in connexion with a prefix ka ; thus , ka-lunch , got angry ; ka-hō-sas , he was lost ; ka-rhō-chas , he was alarmed .
The base is sometimes reduplicated in the past , and suffixes such as dī , ti , and n , all probably various forms of the copula , are added .
Future .
The present is apparently also used as a future ; thus , di-ś , I shall go ; lē-ti , I shall say .
According to the list of words the most common future suffix seems to contain a t.Imperative .
The base alone is often used as an imperative ; thus , kur , take ; dā , give ; chuksan-gā , cloth make , put on .
Common imperative suffixes are nē , and tē , the latter also occurring as tai and dai .
The materials available do not contain any example of a negative imperative .
Verbal nouns .
The base alone is used as a verbal noun .
The usual suffix is m or mō ; thus , sai-m chyung-ni , to strike is proper ; di-mō-k man ma gā-s , going-of mind not made , he did not want to go ; pā-mi-k , measuring for , in order to measure .
A suffix t apparently occurs in pyaugat , to fill .
Participles which are used as adjectives are formed by adding n , past san , to the base ; thus , jā-n sich , eating were ; sīchã-n sis , dying I am ; tā-san bōjh , the left load , the load which had been left ; pyū-san , filled , full .
The suffix s , sē , ch , chai , chu , or chē forms conjunctive participles .
Such forms are occasionally also used as adjectives ; thus , khu-rāch māl , theft-come property , stolen property .
Other conjunctive participles are formed by adding the suffixes nē , ( nyā ) and tē ; thus , vī-nē , calling ; rhā-nē , bringing ; dū-nyā , gathering ; hō-tī , leaving .
In pī-k kurs , taking up carried , a suffix k has apparently been added .
Negative particle .
The negative particle is a prefixed ma , or , sometimes , mu .
The order of words is the same as in connected forms of speech , subject , object , verb .
Adjectives and numerals precede the qualified word .
Their language is closely related to the Tibetan of Tibet proper .
On the other hand , it is almost devoid of tones , and in this respect it agrees with the Tibeto-Burman languages of Assam and Burma as against the dialects of Central Tibet .
In such and in many other characteristics Baltī agrees with the dialect spoken in Ladakh .
The Tibetan dialect of the province of Purik forms a link between Baltī and Ladakhī .
In the report of the last Census of Kashmir the term Baltī apparently includes the languages spoken in Baltistan and Purik .
In this Survey , however , it will be used to denote the dialect spoken in Baltistan proper , excluding the province of Purik to the west of the Suru River .
Baltī is the prevailing language all over Baltistan .
We do not know anything about the existence of local variations in the dialect .
Some old historical books in the Baltī dialect are still in the possession of the present Rājaṣ They are written in a peculiar character , which was perhaps invented at the time of the conversion of the Baltīs to Muhammadanism about 1400 A.D.
I am indebted to Mr.R .T.Clarke , I.C.S., for a version of the Parable of the Prodigal Son and a list of Standard Words and Phrases in Baltī .
The vowels of open syllables are mostly long , and those of closed syllables short ; thus , mī , man ; min , is not .
The final a of the article and of case suffixes is , however , short .
In such connexions as minduk , classical mi ’ adug , the ’ a is pronounced and transliterated as n .The consonants are , broadly speaking , the same as in classical Tibetan .
Soft consonants at the end of a syllable are always hardened ; thus , chik , classical gchig , one ; rgyap-la , behind .
This is especially the case when g is a prefix or is followed by another consonant .
The consonant r when prefixed to another consonant often becomes sh or s ; thus , sta or rsta , classical rta , horse .
Compound consonants , initial as well as final , which are so marked a characteristic of classical Tibetan , are also frequent in Baltī .
This latter dialect can even boast of some additional final compounds .
Suffixes .
In addition to the suffixes used in the declension and conjugation we may note chan , khan , and chas .
Chan is used as in classical Tibetan to form possessive compounds ; thus , nyes-pā-chan , sin having , a sinner ; an-chan , power having , mighty .
Khan and chas seem to be used in order to form participles and verbal nouns ; thus , rgā-khan-kun , friends ; nyam-pō-yot-khan chi , a servant ; stor-khan-pō , lost ; yot-chas-kun , goods ; gon-chas-kun , robes .
Compare the Ladakhī suffixes khan and ches .
Toneṣ Baltī does not appear to possess a marked system of tones .
In this respect it agrees with Purik and Ladakhī .
Articles .
There is no definite article .
The numeral chik , one , is often used as an indefinite article .
Nouns .
Gender is only distinguished in the case of animate beings .
It is denoted by using different words or by adding suffixes .
Number .
There are two numbers , the singular and the plural .
The plural is not marked when it appears from the context ; thus , khō-la hlam skon , him-on shoes put ; ngī atā-la nyampō-duk-khan mot-pō yot , my father-to servant many are .
The usual plural suffix is kun or gun , all , which is often abbreviated to ngun , un .
Another plural suffix is chōk ; thus , yot-chas-kun-chōk , goods , all goods .
Case .
The nominative and the accusative are not distinguished by means of suffixes .
The nominative is used as the subject of intransitive verbs .
The subject of transitive verbs , on the other hand , is put in the case of the agent .
The suffix of that case is s ; thus , attā-s , by the father .
The suffix of the dative is la ; thus , atā-la , to a father ; atā-un-la , to fathers .
The suffix la is used in the same wide sense as in classical Tibetan ; thus , brok-la , on the mountain pasture ; lam-tha gh - ring gul chīla , to a distant country .
The dative is sometimes also used as an accusative ; thus , ngas khōi phrū-la ...tᵉangs , I have beaten his son .
The suffix la is , moreover , sometimes also used to denote the agent ; thus , attā-la khurī phrū thong , the father saw his son .
The suffix of the ablative is nā , corresponding to classical Tibetan nas .
It is commonly used to form adverbs .
A common postposition of the ablative in the case of rational beings is shiti-a-nā , from the direction of .
It is usually combined with the genitive .
The genitive is formed by adding the suffix ī , which supersedes a final ā .
Note forms such as chig-gī , of one , from chik , one , where the final g has not been changed to k.There are some few traces left of the old terminative ; thus , ok-tu , under ; thur-u , down ; dun-u , dun-uk , before ; ya-r , up .
The vocative is indicated by prefixing the interjection lē ; thus , lē attā , O father .
Adjectives .
Adjectives do not differ from nouns in form .
They usually precede , but sometimes also follow , the noun they qualify ; thus , mot-pō namzē , much time ; nyampō-duk-khan mot-pō , many servants .
The particle of comparison is ba ts ek ; thus , khōi phōnō khur-ri string-mō ba ts ek rgōbong thonmō-yot , his brother his sister-than more tall-is , his brother is taller than his sister .
Adjectives are often qualified by adverbs such as mā , very ; mang-mō , very much , and so forth .
Numerals .
The first numerals are given in the list of words .
They follow the word they qualify , and postpositions are accordingly added to them and not to the qualified noun ; thus , mī chik-la , man one-to .
Generic suffixes are used in two instances .
Pronouns .
The personal pronouns which occur in the texts are as follows .
Yang is used as an honorific form and perhaps also as a plural .
Demonstrative pronouns are di , diū , dō , this ; dō-nā , from this ; dē , that ; dē-vi , dē-bi , of that ; dē-bᵉang-nā , from them .
Interrogative pronouns are sū , who ?
Indefinite pronouns are sūsē , anyone , lit .
There are no relative pronouns .
They precede the qualified noun in the genitive ; thus , ngā-ang-la ong-ma-yot-pī pō , me-to coming-of share , the share that falleth to me ; ngā-la yot-pī yot-chas-kun , me-to being-of goods , the goods that are mine .
Verbs .
The conjugation of verbs is , broadly speaking , effected in the same way as in classical Tibetan .
The materials available are not sufficient to allow us to judge about the use of the various bases of verbs .
It is probable that the past base is commonly used in all tenses , just as is the case in Ladakhī .
The imperative is , however , often formed from a separate base .
There is apparently an incipient tendency to distinguish the person of the subject by means of suffixes added to the verb .
The verb substantive is formed from the bases in , yot , and duk .
It is freely used in the formation of the finite tenses of other verbs .
The base of the present tense is identical with the root of the verb .
The mere present base does not , however , occur in the materials available in other verbs than the verb substantive yot , am , art , etc.
The usual present tense of finite verbs is a compound form .
It is effected by adding suffixes to the present base .
The common suffixes are nuk , et , and at , all various forms of the copula .
A present definite is formed by adding yot to the participle ending in in ; thus , ts hō-in-yot , he is grazing .
Past time .
The usual base of the past tense is formed by adding s to the present base .
By adding the copula et or at to the past base a compound past is effected , which usually has the meaning of a perfect .
The participle ending in pa , ba , is commonly used as a past tense of auxiliary verbs .
The suffix pa is also added to the form ending in set or to the present ; thus , tᵉang-s-et-pa , was striking ; song-s-et-pa , have walked ; skang-at-pa , filled , was filling .
A past tense can also be formed by adding song or songs , went , to the infinitive .
Future .
The termination of the future tense is uk .
Some verbs have a separate imperative base formed by changing the vowel a of the present base to o ; thus , tᵉong , strike , tᵉang-mō , to strike ; zō , eat , base zā .
In other verbs the present base , with or without the addition shik , is used as an imperative .
Verbal nouns .
The usual suffixes of verbal nouns are pō , bō , mō , pa , ba , and la ; thus , yot-pō , to be ; zer-bō , to say ; tᵉang-mō , to strike ; ts hō-la , to feed .
The suffix chas in gon-chas , cloth , has already been mentioned .
The suffixes pa and ma form relative and adverbial participles ; thus , shī-s-pa , dead ; ong-ma-yot-pa , coming-being , which will come .
Compare the instances quoted under the head of relative pronouns .
The suffixes chas and khan have already been mentioned above .
Conjunctive participles are formed by adding the suffix ē to the present or past base .
Other participles and verbal nouns are formed by adding the ordinary case suffixes .
The ablative suffix nā is added to the conjunctive participle ending in sē and to the participle ending in mā .
The locative suffix in is added to the present base ; thus , ts hō-in , grazing ; lto kh s-in , hungry .
The dative suffix la is used to form an infinitive of purpose ; thus , bᵉyā-la , in order to make .
Passive voice .
There is no passive voice .
Passivity is sufficiently indicated by the absence of the case of the agent in the subject .
There is one single instance of the classical causative formed by prefixing an s , viż , s-kon , make him put on , dress .
Negative verb .
The negative particle is a prefixed mā ; thus , mā-rgal-ba , did not pass ; met , no ; men , am not .
The form met is usually added to the participle in pa or ma in order to form a compound negative .
There are no instances in the texts of a negative imperative .
Interrogative particle .
The usual order of words is subject , object , verb .
The object may precede the subject when it is followed by the suffix la .
The genitive precedes the governing word .
Adjectives and pronouns usually precede the noun they qualify , while numerals follow it .
Adverbs are put immediately before the verb , or at the beginning of the sentence .
This is the language of an Aboriginal Tribe called Kamār or Kãwāṛ It is returned only from the district of Raipur , as spoken by 3,743 souls .
It has been shown that out of the 7,817 Kamārs counted at the Census of 1891 , only 4,009 have been returned as speaking the Kamārī language .
The rest speak the language of their more civilised neighbours .
Kamārī has hitherto been considered to be a Dravidian language , and , as such , it was classed in the Preliminary Rough List of the Languages of Raipur compiled for this Survey .
A short list of words in the dialect of the ‘ Komărs ’ has been printed by Mr.P .N .Bose , in his Chhattisgar : Notes on its Tribes , Sects and Castes .
Kamārī is a dialect of the same stamp as Halᵃbī .
It agrees with some Aryan languages in some points , and with others in others .
So little has it been assimilated that even the use of the various case-suffixes is vague and uncertain .
The form hunā-chē , from the demonstrative pronoun hun , occurs for instance as a genitive , as a dative , and even as a nominative .
The Kamārs are stated to resemble the Gōṇḍs in appearance , and it is very probable that their original dialect was some form of Gōṇḍī .
The inflection of nouns also agrees with Halᵃbī in so far as the oblique form does not differ from the base , and there does not exist a proper plural .
The usual case suffixes are , Thus , abhār-kē ulᵃṭā , against Heaven ; nāchā-dē śabad , the sound of dancing ; apan-kā gāgᵃrā , your son .
The personal pronouns usually take the plural form ; thus , am , I .
They form their genitive by adding chō , chā , or chē ; thus , ām-chō kaṛᵃhō , my son ; tum-chō sāmᵃnē , before you ; tum-chā bhāud , your brother ; tum-chē chākᵃrī , your service .
The verb substantive is formed from the bases hō and āchh ; thus , hō , he is ; āchhē , thou art , he is , and they are .
The form āchhat , he was , is originally the third person plural of the present tense .
There are no instances of a real past tense of this verb .
The suffix dē which plays a great rôle in the conjugation of the finite verb in Halᵃbī is also frequent in Kamārī .
It will be seen that such forms are used as a present , a past , and a future .
They are all present participles .
The true past tense is sometimes formed by adding iyā , and sometimes by adding lā ; thus , chumbiyā , he kissed ; miviyō , he was found ; jālā and jālō , he became ; bāp-nē husē dēkhiyā , dayā kēlā , the father saw him and had compassion .
Future forms such as khāvā~ , I will eat ; bōlᵃvā~ , I will say , also occur in Halᵃbī .
In the verbal noun and the conjunctive participle we find the same mixture of dialects .
Causals are apparently formed as in Marāṭhī ; thus , nisāvā , cause him to put on ; nigāvā , bring out .
The preceding remarks will be sufficient to show the mixed character of the dialect .
Kamārī or Kãwārī Dialect .
Mr.Soppitt found them in the Cachar Hills and says about them̊ ‘ These people have only very lately come from Lushai-land , and there are no great number of them in British territory .
The Rāltēs have accepted the domination of the Duliens , but are said to have retained their customs and their language .
Amongst the Rāltēs , however , the Dulien language is generally understood , though I have come across more than one instance lately in which Rāltēs , both men and women , though they understood the Dulien when they heard it spoken , were unable to use it with sufficient freedom to reply to questions in it .
The differences between the two languages are very considerable , and a man who has a very thorough knowledge of Dulien only is quite at sea if addressed in the Rāltē language ’ .
It shows that the Rāltē dialect of the Lushai Hills has been largely influenced by Lushēi , the principal language of the district .
Long vowels are not marked , but probably every final vowel of a word or syllable is long , just as in Lushēi .
The abrupt shortening of a vowel is indicated by adding an h , but this pronunciation seems to be rather indistinct , for we find , for instance , the same words written mu and muh , ka and kah .
The same remark holds good with regard to the vowel a^ .
When o is followed by a vowel a euphonic v is inserted , thus lo-v-a , in the fields ; tho-v-ing-a , will arise ; a-pe-shi-o-v-u-a , they gave not , etc.
Articles .
There are no articles in the language .
The numeral ‘ one , ’ and indefinite pronouns are used instead of an indefinite article ; pronominal prefixes , demonstrative pronouns , or relative participles supply the place of a definite article .
Nouns .
Gender is only apparent in the case of animate nouns .
Names of animals are neuter when they are not distinguished by generic suffixes .
Gender is not distinguished when no ambiguity can arise .
Pa denoting males , is the only generic suffix occurring in the specimens .
Number .
There are two numbers , singular and plural .
The number of the subject of a sentence is indicated by the pronominal prefix .
When it is necessary to indicate the plural , the suffix ke is used .
This suffix seems to be added to the last part of a compound word though it belongs to the first , thus , vok-cha^-ke , pigs , food , liṭ , pig-foods .
A short postposition may be inserted between the noun and the suffix , thus , khut-a-ke , on the hands ; but ka-thian-ke lak-a , with my friends .
Case .
The Nominative is formed without any suffix .
The suffix in denoting the agent , is added to a noun when it is the subject of a transitive verb , thus , cha-pa-in a-ti-a , his son he-said .
In may be inserted between the different parts of a compound pronoun ; thus , mi ku-in-ai-ma^ , a certain man , where ku-ai-ma^ is the pronoun .
No suffixes of the Accusative and the Dative occur in the specimen .
The Genitive is denoted by the bare stem preceding the governing word ; thus , ro ka-chan-ai , of the property my share .
There is apparently no instance of a used as a suffix of the genitive .
The suffixes of the Locative are in and a ; thus lim-tak-in , joy-great-in ; khua-a , in a village .
The interjection he is prefixed to the Vocative , thus , he pa , O father .
Adjectives .
Adjectives follow the noun they qualify , and case suffixes are added to them , not to the qualified noun ; thus , kha^-lam la-tak-a , into a very distant country .
The suffix of the comparative degree is za^k or zok , and that of the superlative ber ; thus , nao-pang za^k , younger ; pha ber , best .
Numerals .
The numerals follow the noun .
Only the two first numerals occur .
Pa is the generic prefix ; see Introduction , p .19 .
Pronouns .
The following are the Personal pronouns : Singular , Plural , The forms ka , na , a , and a-u , also occur as pronominal prefixes , see below .
Thus , ka-mu-leh-ka-u , we saw-again , where the first ka is the pronoun ; a-pa-nih-u , they two .
A Reflexive pronoun is perhaps i in i-mu-leh-ka a-hi-e , mutually ( i.e., by us ) seen again he is .
The Demonstrative pronouns are hi , hi-hi , this ; chu , chu-chu , that .
There is no Relative pronoun , its place being supplied by the use of participles or verbal nouns .
The only instance of an Interrogative pronoun is i-ha , what ?
The Indefinite pronouns which occur in the specimen are kuai-ma^ , a certain ; ku-ma , any one ; i-kha^ or i-kho , some , whatever ; i-ma , anything .
Verbs .
Verbs are conjugated in person and number by means of pronominal prefixes .
When the subject is a neuter noun the prefix a is also used to denote the plural ; thus , vok-in a chak , the pigs ate .
The verb is inserted between the two parts of the plural prefixes , thus , a-pe-shi-o-v u-a , they gave not .
Compare also below , Imperative and Present participle .
The prefixes are dropped in the imperative and after nai , ai , me .
The root alone is freely used to denote the present and past tenses ; thus a hi , he is , or was .
The particle e may be added ; thus a hi-e , he is .
The suffix a is used in the same way ; thus , a ti-a , he said .
When the sentence is dependent on a subsequent clause to complete the meaning of the speaker ( compare below , Conjunctive participle ) , this a may be translated ‘ and ’ , the conjunction leh , and , being only used to connect words , not sentences .
The suffix of Past tenses is ka , ka-a , thus , a kel-ka-a , he went .
The suffix tah in i-ha hi-tah , what is that ?
is also a suffix of the past or completed action .
A kind of Perfect is effected by adding the verb substantive ; thus , a hong-dam-leh-ka a-hi , he came alive again it is , he has indeed revived .
The suffix of the Future is ing , ing-a , thus ka tho-v-ing-a , I will arise ; ka ti-ing , I will say .
The suffix of the Imperative is a^h , oh , plural u-a ; thus , pia-a^h , give ; thei-oh , listen ; tal-u-a , kill you .
The first person plural is formed by the prefix i , and the suffix ing ; thus , i-cha ing , let us eat .
The Infinitive is formed without any suffix , thus ; chak-vah , to eat .
The suffix of the infinitive of purpose is ang , nang , ang-in ; thus , lim-nang , in order to rejoice ; pia-ang-in , in order to give .
The suffix of the Present participle is lan , leng .
There are no instances of a participle referring to the first person , to the second person singular , or the third person plural .
In the second person plural un is prefixed to lan or u is prefixed , and a suffixed .
The former method seems to be due to the influence of Standard Lushēi where n is the common plural suffix in the pronominal prefixes .
In the third person singular the termination seems to be leng .
This participle is substituted for the imperative when more than one forms of the mood follow each other , the last one only remaining in the imperative .
If ma be inserted between the verb and the ending , the meaning becomes ‘ although ’ .
The locative suffixes a and in are used in forming Adverbial and Conjunctive participles .
The suffix a is very freely used after all tenses , see above .
A Noun of agency is formed by adding the suffix tu ; thus , na shum cha-zo-vek-tu , your property ’ s waster .
There is no Passive voice ; ka-mu-leh-ka-u a-hi , he was found again , literally means ‘ we saw him again it is , ’ ‘ we certainly saw him again ’ .
Compound verbs are freely used and suffixes are then added to the last component .
Thus , Causatives are formed with tik ; thus , han-bun-tik-u-a , cause him to wear .
Desideratives are formed with nuam , to wish ; thus , a lut-nuam-mo-v-a , he to-enter-wished-not .
The verb da^n has the meaning ‘ to be about ; ’ thus ka thi-da^n-a , I am about to die .
The Negative particle is o , thus ka hi-o , I am not ; lut-nuam-m-o-va , to enter wished not .
The usual order of words is subject , direct object , indirect object , verb .
The genitive precedes the governing word .
Adjectives and numerals follow the word they qualify .
Demonstrative pronouns seem to be put at the beginning of the clause .
So far as can be judged , from their language , the Asurs are closely related to the Korwāṣ Colonel Dalton connects the Asurs with the Asuras who , according to Muṇḍā tradition , were destroyed by Siṅboṅga , and Mr.Risley is inclined to think that they are the remnant of a race of earlier settlers who were driven out by the Muṇḍāṣ The Rev .
F.Hahn mentions that the Asurī dialect contains some Dravidian words which have possibly been borrowed from Kurukh , and also some words which he cannot identify in connected languages .
It will , however , be shown later on that at least some of the words which Mr.Hahn thinks are neither Kurukh nor Muṇḍā are used in other connected forms of speech .
Moreover , Asurī grammar so closely agrees with Santālī and Muṇḍārī that there is no philological reason for separating the Asurs from other Muṇḍā tribes .
They believe in a god whom they apparently identify with Siṅboṅga , the sun , and their religion is , so far as we know , of the common Muṇḍā character .
and in the so-called Māñjhī both represent a form of speech which is apparently most closely related to Asurī .
It will be seen that these forms of speech are rapidly dying out , and their total disappearance can only be a question of time .
Ferḍ , A Primer of the Asur dukmā , a dialect of the Kolarian language .
Language.Severalspecimens of Asurī have been received from Ranchi and from the Jashpur State .
It represents the same form of speech as ordinary Asurī .
They are very corrupt and represent a mixed form of speech .
Like Tūrī , Asurī is a dialect of the language which we have called Kherwārī , the two principal forms of which are Santālī and Muṇḍārī .
Asurī is more closely related to the latter than to the former , though it , in many respects , agrees with Santālī .
The pronunciation mainly agrees with Muṇḍārī .
Mr.Hahn does not mention the semi-consonants .
He speaks of ‘ the check which often occurs after a vowel and especially when two vowels stand together ’ .
This remark can only refer to the semi-consonants , and I have , therefore , added them in the specimen within parenthesis .
The Jashpur specimens mark the semi-consonants , though in a very inconsistent way .
As in Muṇḍārī and Hō , the corresponding soft consonants are often substituted for them .
Mr.Hahn usually writes a long vowel instead of a final semi-consonant .
In other cases he uses the corresponding soft consonant .
Spellings such as goj and god , die ; ved-kan-ā , has come ; but vej-u ( k ’ ) - mē , come , however , point to the conclusion that the phonetical system of Asurī in this respect agrees with Santālī and Muṇḍārī , and I have therefore added the sign of the semi-consonants .
Soft consonants are apparently sometimes substituted for hard ones ; thus , doho-ken-ā , was , compare Dhaṅgâṛ dā^hâk ’ - ken-ā ; gatad-i-ā , he said to him , and so forth .
In all the cases mentioned , and in several similar ones , Asurī agrees with Santālī .
It is very unsafe to base any conclusions on such facts so long as we do not know more of Asurī , and of the formation of words in the Muṇḍā languages in general .
According to Mr.Hahn there are many words in Asur which he cannot identify in connected languages .
The case with the other words mentioned by Mr.Hahn is probably similar , and all words in Asurī which are not true Muṇḍā words are probably borrowed from some Aryan or Dravidian form of speech .
Nouns .
The inflexion of nouns is quite regular .
The suffixes of the dual and the plural are kin : , kū ( or kō ) , respectively .
The dative-accusative is sometimes formed by adding the Aryan suffix kē .
Usually , however , the dative and the accusative are indicated in the verb .
The suffixes of the genitive are ā ( i.e.
Numerals .
The first numerals are 1 , mīat ’ ; 2 , bariā ; 3 , pēā ; 4 , upuniā ; 5 , moyā~ ; 6 , turiā ; 7 , aiyā ; 8 , irliyā ; 9 , areā ; 10 , geleā .
For five , etc., however , the Hindī numerals are commonly used .
Pronouns .
The personal pronouns are regular .
There is some confusion in the use of the suffixed pronouns in the specimens .
The demonstrative pronouns are hinī , this ; dual , hi-kin : , plur .
The same forms are said to be used for inanimate nouns as well .
In other respects the pronouns are apparently quite regular .
Verbs .
There is a verb īdan-ā , ( he ) is , which is often used as an impersonal verb ; thus , īdan-me-ā , thou art.
The passive is formed by adding o or vā , i.e.
The tenses are , so far as we can judge from the materials , formed as in Mụṇḍārī .
Note the prefixing of ov ( i.e.
w ) before suffixes beginning with a vowel ; thus , hāṭiṅ-ovat ’ - kiṅ-ā , divided to them two .
The future does not take any suffix .
The suffix of the present is tan ; thus , ñel-tan-ā-e , he sees .
The suffix nen is especially common in the Jashpur specimens .
There is a verbal noun ending in ta ’ - ā , i.e.
The noun of agency ends in ae , i.e.
The negative particles are kā , alō , and alo-kā .
The causative particle is said to be gē ; thus , duṛup ’ - gē-tan-ā-in : , I cause to sit .
It can however be doubted whether this gē is not the ordinary intensifying particle gē .
In other respects Asurī seems to agree very closely with Muṇḍārī and Santālī .
