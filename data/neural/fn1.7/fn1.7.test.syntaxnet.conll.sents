The subject usually commences the sentence , and the verb usually ends it .
Marāṭhī is the principal language of Berar and of the southern part of the Central Provinces .
It has already been mentioned that the usual Dekhan form of the language is current in the western part of Buldana , and in some districts to the north of the Satpuras , which formerly belonged to the dominions of the Peshwas .
The dialect spoken over the greater part of Berar and in the south of the Central Provinces is , however , slightly different .
Area in which spokeṇBeginning from the west this dialect covers the eastern part of Buldana , leaving the western border to Standard Marāṭhī .
The dialect is further spoken by scattered settlers in Raipur , Bilaspur , Nandgaon , Kawardha , and Bombay Town and Island .
Name of the dialecṭThe Marāṭhī of Berar is usually spoken of as Varhāḍī or Bērārī , and Nāgpurī is the traditional name of the dialect spoken in the Central Provinces .
Both names have been retained , in deference to the traditional usage , though they in reality connote the same form of speech .
Several smaller dialects of Marāṭhī have been returned from the districts under consideration .
Spoken abroad in It has been stated above that several minor dialects which were originally returned from Berar and the Central Provinces have proved to be local forms of the current Marāṭhī of the said districts .
Of these minor dialects the Marhēṭī of Balaghat has been slightly influenced by the neighbouring dialects of Eastern Hindī , and the Natakānī of Chanda has , in some points , accommodated itself to Telugu .
On the whole , however , the various forms of speech enumerated in the table are essentially identical with the form of Marāṭhī commonly spoken in Berar and the Central Provinces .
This form of speech has also largely influenced the dialect of the Katiās of Chhindwara and Narsinghpur , which has therefore been dealt with after the minor dialects just mentioned .
We thus arrive at the following total for the Marāṭhī of Berar and the Central Provinces : In connection with this form of speech it has been found convenient to deal with some broken dialects spoken in the Bastar State , Kanker , and Raipur , which have been largely influenced by the neighbouring Marāṭhī .
GrammaṛThe Marāṭhī spoken in Berar and the Central Provinces is closely related to the form which that language assumes in the Dekhan .
The difference between the two forms of speech is slight , and they gradually merge into each other in Buldana .
Long vowels , and especially final ones , are very frequently shortened ; thus , mī and mi , I ; māhi bāyᵃkō , my wife ; māhā and mahā , my .
As in the Konkan , an a is very commonly used where the Dekhan form of the language has an ē , especially in the termination ē~ of neuter bases , in the suffix nē~ of the instrumental , and in the future .
In some rustic dialects this short final a is occasionally dropped altogether ; thus , tyān , by him , in the so-called Dhanᵃgarī and Gōvārī of Chhindwara .
The cerebral ḍ , when preceded by a vowel , is pronounced as an r .in the so-called Māhārī of Chhindwara .
The same is probably also the case in the rustic dialects in other districts .
Thus , in the so-called Dzhāṛpī and Kōshṭī of Ellichpur we find forms such as ghōḷā , a horse , and in the dialect of the Kuṇᵃbīs of Akola d.is substituted for l .in words such as dzavaḍ , near .
All these facts can only be explained on the assumption that the cerebral l .has a sound which is very near to that of a cerebral ṛ , and that the cerebral d.after vowels assumes the same sound .
Nouns .
The substitution of a for ē~ in neuter bases , together with the tendency to shorten long final vowels , has caused the distinction between the masculine and neuter genders to be weakened .
In the dialect of the Kuṇᵃbīs of Akola and Chanda , of the Gōvārs of Chanda and Bhandara , in the Marhēṭī of Balaghat , the Marāṭhī dialect of Raipur , and so on , the masculine and neuter genders are constantly confounded .
The neuter gender is thoroughly preserved only in Marāṭhī and Gujarāṭī , and it will therefore be seen that the dialect of Berar and the Central Provinces in this respect forms a link between those languages and the related forms of speech to the north and east .
The plural is formed as in Standard Marāṭhī .
In the oblique form plural , however , hī or ī is often added ; thus , bāpāhīs , to fathers ; mānᵃsāi-lē , to men .
The case suffixes are the same as in the Dekhan .
The dative , however , is formed by adding lē and not lāin most of the rustic dialects such as the Kuṇᵃbī of Akola and 
The case of the agent of the personal pronoun of the second person is tyā , by thee ; ‘ my ’ is māh.ā, and ‘ thy ’ is tuhā .
The usual form of the nominative singular feminine is , however , tē as in Old Marāṭhī .
There is only one conjugation ; thus , mī marᵃtō , I die ; mī mārᵃtō , I strike ; mī mhanīn , I shall say ; mī karīn , I shall do ; mī asal , or asīn , I shall be , and so on .
The second person singular has ụsually the same form as the third person ; thus , tū āhē , thou art ; tū gēlā , thou wentest .
Similarly the second person plural of the past tense coincides with the third person ; thus , tumhī gēlē , you went ; tē gēlē , they went .
In the first person singular of the present tense , however , we find mī āhō and mī āhē , I am .
From the root hō is formed mī vhay , I am , etc.
In the past tense vha is interchangeable with hō ; thus , tū hōtā or vhatā , thou wast .
The present tense of finite verbs is often formed as in the Dekhan ; thus , mī karᵃtō , I do ; tū karᵃtō ( s ) , thou dost ; tē karᵃtāt , they do .
Frequently , however , the second and third persons singular and the third person plural are formed in the same way as in the verb substantive , in which case the verb does not change for gender ; thus , tu rāhᵃtē ( s ) , thou livest ; tō yētē , he comes ; tō karᵃtyē , he does ; tē dzātēt , they go .
In Berar a is substituted for ē in the terminations of the second person singular and the third person plural ; thus , tū mārᵃta , thou strikest ; tē mārᵃtat , they strike .
In the imperative we may note forms such as dzāy , go ; khāy , eat ( Berar ) ; pāhya , see .
The habitual past is often used as an ordinary past .
The third person singular of transitive verbs sometimes ends in an ; thus , dhāḍᵃlan , sent .
Such forms occur in the rustic dialects of Ellichpur , Chhindwara , and Bhandara .
In some rustic dialects in Chhindwara , Bhandara , and Balaghat , however , the influence of the neighbouring dialects of Eastern Hindī has caused the passive and impersonal constructions to be frequently superse.dedby the active one , and we find forms such as mī pāp kēlō , I sinned .
In the future we must note forms such as mī asal , I shall be ; tū mārᵃsīn , thou wilt strike ; tē mārᵃtīn , they will strike .
Note also forms such as pāhādzōs , thou wilt see , which are properly a future imperative .
The total number of speakers in Akola has been estimated at 465 , 600 , and there remain thus 4,000 regarding whom we are unable to tell to which of the two dialects they belong .
It has fallen under the influence of the neighbouring Gujarātī and Bhīl languages , and also of the Khāndēśī which lies to its south .
Thus the sign of the agent case is na , not nē , and of the locative ma , not mē~ .
The letters l and n are interchangeable as in līm and nīm , tree .
In the neighbouring Bhīl languages , both j and ch are commonly pronounced as s.In Nīmāḍī , ch seems to be pronounced according to its proper sound , but j is often interchanged with it .
The letter jh is often pronounced as a z , as in the Marāṭhī of Berar , and as in some forms of Khāndēśī .
In the declension of nouns , the common form in ē , which in Rājasthānī is used sometimes for the agent and sometimes for the locative , appears in Nīmāḍī as ending in a .
Accusative-dative , ka .
Instrumental-ablative , sī , sū .
Genitive , kō , ( kā , kī ) .
Locative , ma .
We occasionally find the Rājasthānī kā , and the Bundēlī khē ( under the form of kha ) used for the Accusative-dative .
In two instances I have noted kā used to agree with feminine nouns .
wō ; oblique uṇ .
Jō , who ( singular and plural ) ; jē-kō , of whom ; oblique singular jē .
The present tense of the verb substantive is chhē , which ( like the Khāndēśī sē ) does not change for number or person .
The past tense of the verb substantive is thō ( thā , thī ) , as in Mālvī .
When used as an auxiliary verb chhē drops the final ē and its aspiration , and becomes ch , which in its turn ( especially in Bhopawar ) often bccomes j .
We thus get the following form of the present of mārᵃṇū , to strike .
The future ( as in Gujarātī ) has s for its characteristic letter , and is conjugated as follows .
Sometimes we find the true Mālvī future formed by adding an unchangeable gā .
The infinitive ends in ṇū , thus , mārᵃṇū , to strike ; when used as a participle future passive , its subject is put in the case of the agent .
Thus , apaṇ-na anand manāwᵃṇū nī khūsī hōṇū , joy was meet to be celebrated and happiness was meet to be ( note that the participle is masculine although agreeing with a feminine noun ) by us .
Substantives and adjectives make their oblique forms as in the Standard .
The plural oblique terminations are au and ū , both of which are frequently nasalized .
The usual oblique form of tū , thou , is twai , as in twai-na ( ag .
For yō , this , he , and wō , that , he , we have : The Reflexive Pronoun is āphū , self ; genitive apṇō .
The Interrogative Pronouns are kō ( declined like jō ) , who ?
Chha may also be used for any person , as in tū ab marna tyār chha , thou art ready to die .
The usual past is thayō , was ; plural thayā ; fem .
The first is a present definite , mārdō chhaũ , I am striking .
For the Future we have in the masculine : Similarly , jaulō , I will go ; bōllō , I will say ; rahlī ( fem .
For the indefinite article , the numeral mē , one , is employed .
The Accusative takes no termination , as in ā-hong ā-pui un-kē-lā-lē , wasted the whole of his property .
The Genitive takes no termination , and precedes the noun that governs it , as in the-bd chu , swine ’ s food .
Other suffixes of case are kā or ki , to ; hu , to ; ki , from ; kā , in ; nyü , in ; ghenyü , from ; zanho , with .
They take the prefix ke as in Angāmi , thus , ke-gwā , good .
This is also strikingly true with the personal pronouns , those of the first and third persons being identical in form .
It is possible that in such cases the two words which are the same in appearance are distinguished by being pronounced with different tones , but no information is available on this point .
The nē of the second form and the n of the third , may be corruptions of the Nominative suffix lē , or nē and n may be contracted forms of nyo .
For the plural the list of words gives apürenyi , and also haghu-nē .
The most common verb substantive is bi-nē , is or was .
In the case of other verbs , the most usual suffix of the present is lē or nē as in vü-lē , beats ; tē-bi-nē is making .
In tē-bi-nyong , was doing , nyong apparently gives a continuative or durative sense .
An example of the simplest form of a past tense is zō-lē , said .
In un-kē-lā-lē , wasted , and gü-rā-lē , came back , lā and rā are infixes modifying the root-meaning , and not tense-signs .
Other forms translated as past tenses are pfsü-lā-tà , gave ; zō-yā , said ; ā-zō-hā-shi , ordered ; zō-ni-shi-lē , and zō-ni-shi , said .
The simplest form of the future is vü-ti , will strike .
As in Kezhāmā , the imperative ends sometimes in tà , and sometimes in lo .
As an example of a desiderative verb , we may quote tē-bi-sü-bi-nē , wished to eat .
The negative particle is mo as in ā-tsü-mu-ho , not giving to him , here the mo is changed to mu , probably a false spelling ; ke-mo-tē-lā-si-lē and ke-mo-tē-lā-lē , did not , the root being tē , do ; sā-ri-mo-lē , broke-not ; ā-pfsü-mo-lē , did not give to me .
With regard to consonants it should be noted that the sounds j , dz , z , and zh are not correctly distinguished in the specimens .
On the other hand , hard initials are occasionally softened when preceded by vowels or nasals in compound words ; thus , tham-je , classical thams-chad , all .
With regard to final consonants g is usually changed to k , and b to p ; thus , chik , one ; phak , swine ; lep , arrive .
Compare the suffix of the present participle ken or kin , Ladakhī mkhan .
In compound consonants containing a subscribed y as second component in classical Tibetan , this y is dropped before i and e ; thus , khi , classical khyi , dog ; pe , classical byed , do .
The numeral chik , one , is used as an indefinite , and the demonstrative pronoun di , this , as a definite article ; thus , mi chik , a man ; angsha-di , the share .
Nouns Gender .
Gender is distinguished by using different words or by adding qualifying affixes ; thus , no , brother ; nu-mu , sister : pu , son ; po-mo , daughter : ta-bu , horse ; ta-mu , mare .
The usual suffix of the plural is kya ; thus , aba-kya , fathers ; compare cha in Ḍänjong-kä .
The suffix of the genitive is i , ki , or gi after vowels , and i or ki after consonants .
The same form is also used as a case of the agent .
Di is used alone as a genitive suffix in po-mu-di , of daughters .
Other cases are formed by adding suffixes such as la , in , to ; sa-le , from the place of , from ; minji , minjik , min-zi , min-zik , from ; dung-la , before , etc.
Adjectives sometimes precede and sometimes follow the noun they qualify .
The particle of comparison is the Naipālī bhanda ; thus , kho-i a-zi bhanda no rim-bu-du , his sister than brother tall-is , his brother is taller than his sister .
Pronouns .
The following are the personal pronouns : The pronouns are inflected like nouns .
Other pronouns are di , this ; o and o-di , that ; su , who ?
The usual bases of the verb substantive are e and du .
The verb is still virtually a noun .
The subject of transitive verbs is put in the case of the agent , and the plural suffix kya can be added .
A present is formed by adding yin to a participle ending in ka , pa , etc.
Du-ba , is , in the last instance contains the usual suffix of the participle ; compare also ye-ba , they are .
To in rob-to , they strike , is probably the copula du .
The participle ending in ba or pa is commonly also used as a past tense , especially in the second person ; thus , nyo-ba , I brought , thou broughtest ; kal-pa , wentest ; se-pa , killedest .
The most common past tense is formed by adding song , or , usually , sing , ( i.e., probably süng ) ; thus , gal-song and kal-sing , he went .
The common present is also used as a past ; thus , e-kin , i.e.
The present is also used as a future ; thus , don , I will go ; lap-ken , I will say ; ong-do , I shall be .
As in classical Tibetan , an a is often changed to o in the imperative ; thus , song , go ; so , eat ; long , stand .
The unaltered base is used in forms such as shi , die ; do , go ; ter , give .
Sometimes we find suffixes added such as kong , tong , dung , and ter ; thus , rob-kong ( i.e.
The most common verbal noun is formed by adding che , or , after vowels , ze ; thus , lap-che , to say ; do-ze , to go .
A suffix a occurs in charai-te-ya-la , in order to feed .
Relative participles are formed by adding ken or gen and ba .
The interrogative pronoun kan-di , which ?
Conjunctive participles are formed by adding di , ti , or di-ma-rang ; thus , rob-sing-di , having beaten ; kal-di-ma-rang , having gone .
Ma-rang is a postposition which governs the genitive .
It is therefore also added to the genitive of the base ; thus , sing-i-ma-rang , having been .
The negative particle is a prefixed me or ma ; thus , kal-di me-ken , going not-were , did not go ; me-ter-ekin , not-giving-was , did not give ; ma-nyin , 
To the east of Ahīrwāṭī , in the central part of Gurgaon , and also south of Gurgaon , in the state of Alwar , the language is Mēwātī , of which Ahīrwāṭī is merely a variety .
We thus see that Ahīrwāṭī represents the connecting link between Mēwātī and three other dialects , Bāṅgarū , Bāgṛī , and Shēkhāwāṭī .
Although it has one striking peculiarity , which appears all over the area which it occupies , I allude to the form taken by the verb substantive , it has in other respects various local varieties due to the influence of the neighbouring dialects .
The dialect of Rājasthānī spoken in Malwa is usually called Mālvī ( distinct from the Mālwaī dialect of Pañjābī ) , but is also called Ahīrī ; and that curious form of Gujarātī , which is half a Bhīl dialect , and which is generally known as Khāndēśī , also bears the name of Ahīrāṇī .
Nay more , between Khandesh and the Ahīrwāṭī country of Gurgaon there lies the wild hilly territory occupied by the Bhīls , whose language is nearly allied to that of Khandesh , and it is not impossible that , according to known phonetic rules , the word Bhilla or Bhīl should be explained as an old corruption of the word Ābhīra .
All these colonies of Ahīrs who have been described as possessing languages of their own , have been separated so widely , and for so many centuries , that it is not reasonable to expect that at the present day they should be found using the same form of speech , nor is this the case .
In its grammar Ahīrwāṭī differs but little from Mēwātī .
It is the stepping stone between that dialect and the Bāṅgarū dialect of Western Hindī spoken in Delhi , Rohtak , East Hissar , and Karnal .
In south Rohtak and in the Ḍābar tract of Delhi as we know , the language is actually Ahīrwāṭī .
The nominative of strong masculine nouns of the a base ends in ō , with an oblique singular in ā , thus agreeing with Mēwātī as against Bāṅgarū which has ā , with an oblique ē .
The same rule is followed in adjectives and in the suffixes of the genitive , it 
being understood that when they agree with nouns in the locative , they , as usual in Rājasthānī , end in ē , not ā .
Masculine nouns ending in consonants form the locative in ī , as in gharī , in a house The usual suffix of the dative is nai or nē~ , and the same suffix is also used for the case of the agent .
The genitive suffix is kō , as in Mēwātī .
The agent case is regularly used before the future passive participle , which is the same in form as the infinitive , as in tū-nē~ karᵃṇō thō , it was to be done by thee .
Note that the locative of the genitive is often used for the dative , e.g.
The demonstrative pronouns are yō or yoh ( feminine yā ) , this , oblique singular aĩh or ãh , oblique plural in , often ased in the sense of the singular ; and wō or woh ( feminine wā , that ) , oblique singular waĩh or wãh or ū~ , oblique plural un , also often used as a singular .
As usual the relative pronoun is often employed in the sense of a demonstrative .
Probably the oblique singular of jō and kaun .
In the present this is : The past is thō , was , feminine thī , masculine plural thā .
The syllable gō is someṭimes added to the present , like the gā of Panjābī .
Thus , sai-gō , he is , corresponding to the Panjābī hai-gā In other respects verbs are conjugated as in Mēwātī .
Hunter , W.W., A Comparative Dictionary of the Languages of India and High Asia .
It seems probable that Gurung in this respect agrees with Central Tibetan .
The aspirated soft consonants have apparently developed from older unaspirated sounds .
The plural is not marked when it appears from the context .
The subject of transitive verbs is put in the case of the agent , which is formed by adding a suffix ji or di ; thus , ā-ba-di bī-dī , the father said ; ki-ji hoā-ji , thou struckest .
This suffix is sometimes also written de , and in that case it looks like the postposition de~ or de , classical Tibetan dang , with which , in its turn , is sometimes written di .
The initial d of the suffix of the agent is often pronounced as a th .
The suffix of the dative is lā-di or lāi ; thus , ā-ba-lādi , to a father .
Such forms are sometimes also used to denote the object of transitive verbs ; thus , cha-e jha-lā-di nga-di dhon-di , his son-to me-by struck , I have beaten his son .
The usual suffix of the genitive is e or ye ; thus , dhĩ-ye , of the house .
Another genitive suffix is la ; thus , ā-ba-mae-la , of fathers .
It is probably originally a dative suffix ; compare chiti-la , to senses .
Other relations are indicated by means of postpositions .
The particle of comparison is bhandā ; thus , cha-ma-e ring bhandā cha-ma-e ā-lī nu-ba mu-lā , his sister than his brother tall is , his brother is taller than his sister .
They follow the word they qualify .
Higher numbers are counted in tens ; thus , bhlī-chyu , forty ; ṭu-chyu , sixty ; nī-chyu , seventy ; bhre-chyu , eighty ; ku-chyu , ninety .
Demonstrative pronouns are chu , this ; cha , that .
Interrogative pronouns are khae-pa-chā , who ?
The two last mentioned pronouns contain an indefinite particle yā or yāng .
There is no change for person or number , and the verb is , on the whole , still virtually a noun .
Another base na is used in form such as tõ-si na-bu , am , art , or is , beating .
A third base is ta or tu in ta-di , is ; tũ-di , am ; tab-mu , shall be ; nga lāla tum-mu , I should be , and so forth .
M or ma , i.e., probably the verb substantive mu , is , however .
Forms such as la-sem , did ; ā-ngwe-sem , I did not transgress , seem to contain the conjunctive participle ending in si and the verb substantive .
Forms such as cha-lā , to eat ; plī~-la , to fill , probably contain the same suffix as we have found in use in the formation of the tenses , or else la is a dative suffix .
The verbal noun ending in bā is also used as a relative participle , in which case it usually precedes the qualified noun in the genitive ; thus , dukha ta-be bela-ri , distress befalling time-at , at the time when distress befell him ; jāgīr cha-be mhi , wages eating man , servant .
The same participle is also used in such relative clauses as are introduced by an interrogative pronoun ; thus , nga-la to mu-ba , me-to what being , all that is mine .
The form ending in ba is sometimes also used with the meaning of a conjunctive participle ; thus , bī-ba , having said .
The tense bases are also used as participles ; thus , ti-sim mu-lā , is sitting ; sī-la , dead .
Na is sometimes added to the verb .
For further details the student is referred to the version of the Parable of the Prodigal Son which follows and to the list of Standard Words and Phrases on pp .
Two specimens and a list of Standard Words and Phrases have been forwarded from the district .
Similarly , the various vowels are often interchanged .
Compare ji , jē , jai-gō , my ; li-s , lē-s , and lai-s , said ; mī-s and mai-s , by a man ; sō , sū , sē , and s , the suffix of the case of the agent ; hvāsas and ka-hōsas , was lost ; rō , rī , ri , and r , the suffix of the terminative ; nyā and nē , the suffix of a conjunctive participle , and so forth .
Hard and soft consonants are apparently very freely interchanged ; thus , g and k , the suffix of the genitive ; rā-ch and rā-j , came ; dhuk and ṭuk , all ; bhung-nyā and pun , tall .
Tā , a shorter form of the numeral tā-kā , one , and indefinite pronouns such as khamī , khami-rī , and khami-r , some ; gub , some , and gār , some , are used as indefinite articles ; thus , tā naukar , a servant ; khamī bā , a father ; khamir mī , a man ; gub rhã , a horse ; gār sã-khu , in a village .
There are no instances in the materials available of any suffixes or prefixes used in order to distinguish gender .
The plural is not distinguished by means of any suffix when it can be inferred from the context .
When required , a suffix chan , chã or chā appears to denote the plural ; thus , bē-chan , the bides ; khvi-chã , dogs ; bē-chā-k , of the skins .
A kind of plural can also be effected by adding words such as titi , mhan , many , and so forth ; thus , bā titi , fathers ; mhan bā , fathers .
The various cases are apparently often interchanged .
Thus both the genitive and the dative are used as accusatives , the genitive also occurs with the function of a dative , and so forth .
The regular case system is apparently as follows .
The nominative and the accusative , i.e., the cases of the subject of intransitive verbs and of the object , are not distinguished by means of any suffix , although the genitive and the dative sometimes occur in the function of the object .
The same form is also used as an instrumental ; thus , chābuk-sō , with stripes .
In u-g khamiri-ś kharī ma dā-ś , his anyone-by anything not gave , no one gave him anything , the genitive has apparently been used instead of the dative , or else there is a dative suffix g , k.An ablative is formed by adding the suffix paṭṭī or baṭī .
So far as we can judge from the specimens , the terminative is commonly used as a locative .
It is formed by adding the suffix rō , rī , ri , or r ; thus , la-rō .
Adjectives precede the qualified noun in the nominative .
In nyāpan-sō sērī dhuk-chhan dū-nyā , the small-by son all gathering , the younger son having gathered all , the case suffix has been added to the adjective nyāpan and not , as we would expect , to the noun .
The particle of comparison is hvē ; thus , u pi-khan u rhangśyā hvē mhan mhan śini , his brother his sister from more tall is ; dukh hvē jhyān , all from good , best .
The first numerals are found in the list of words .
They precede the noun they qualify .
The usual forms of the personal pronouns are as follows .
The pronoun u , ō , he , is sometimes used in order to repeat a preceding noun before postpositions or governing words .
Demonstrative pronouns are i , idō , id , and ē , this ; hvē , hvēda , u , that .
The interrogative pronouns are formed from the bases kha , and gu .
The list of Standard Words and Phrases contains a series of verbal forms which do not occur in the specimens .
On the whole , however , the conjugation in Rangkas is apparently less complicated than in the neighbouring dialects of Darma , Chaudangs and Byangs .
There is the same tendency to distinguish the person of the subject in the verb , especially in the case of the second person .
The past tense is sometimes formed by means of reduplication of the base , as is also the case in Chaudāngsī and Byāngsī .
Verb substantive .
The verb substantive is formed from the bases lhē , ni , and si .
The specimens contain very few forms of the present .
In the first person singular we find the compound form sīchãn sis , I am dying ; and in the second person rhai-san , thou livest , occurs .
Both contain the verb substantive , rhai-sa-n also the suffix n of the second person .
It will be seen that there is here no suffix denoting the first person .
The third person singular is formed in various ways .
The base alone is sometimes used ; thus , ding , he falls .
In other cases the suffixes ni and t or d are added .
The common suffix of past time is s or su ; thus , lī-s , he said ; gā-su , he made .
In the first person an i apparently precedes the s , and in the second person n , nau , nai , or nu is inserted .
There are no instances of such forms in the first and second persons .
The s-suffixes are sometimes used in connexion with a prefix ka ; thus , ka-lunch , got angry ; ka-hō-sas , he was lost ; ka-rhō-chas , he was alarmed .
The base is sometimes reduplicated in the past , and suffixes such as dī , ti , and n , all probably various forms of the copula , are added .
The present is apparently also used as a future ; thus , di-ś , I shall go ; lē-ti , I shall say .
According to the list of words the most common future suffix seems to contain a t.Imperative .
The base alone is often used as an imperative ; thus , kur , take ; dā , give ; chuksan-gā , cloth make , put on .
Common imperative suffixes are nē , and tē , the latter also occurring as tai and dai .
The base alone is used as a verbal noun .
A suffix t apparently occurs in pyaugat , to fill .
The suffix s , sē , ch , chai , chu , or chē forms conjunctive participles .
Other conjunctive participles are formed by adding the suffixes nē , ( nyā ) and tē ; thus , vī-nē , calling ; rhā-nē , bringing ; dū-nyā , gathering ; hō-tī , leaving .
In pī-k kurs , taking up carried , a suffix k has apparently been added .
The negative particle is a prefixed ma , or , sometimes , mu .
In such and in many other characteristics Baltī agrees with the dialect spoken in Ladakh .
The Tibetan dialect of the province of Purik forms a link between Baltī and Ladakhī .
In this Survey , however , it will be used to denote the dialect spoken in Baltistan proper , excluding the province of Purik to the west of the Suru River .
The final a of the article and of case suffixes is , however , short .
Soft consonants at the end of a syllable are always hardened ; thus , chik , classical gchig , one ; rgyap-la , behind .
Compound consonants , initial as well as final , which are so marked a characteristic of classical Tibetan , are also frequent in Baltī .
This latter dialect can even boast of some additional final compounds .
In addition to the suffixes used in the declension and conjugation we may note chan , khan , and chas .
Chan is used as in classical Tibetan to form possessive compounds ; thus , nyes-pā-chan , sin having , a sinner ; an-chan , power having , mighty .
Khan and chas seem to be used in order to form participles and verbal nouns ; thus , rgā-khan-kun , friends ; nyam-pō-yot-khan chi , a servant ; stor-khan-pō , lost ; yot-chas-kun , goods ; gon-chas-kun , robes .
Toneṣ Baltī does not appear to possess a marked system of tones .
There is no definite article .
The numeral chik , one , is often used as an indefinite article .
Gender is only distinguished in the case of animate beings .
It is denoted by using different words or by adding suffixes .
There are two numbers , the singular and the plural .
The plural is not marked when it appears from the context ; thus , khō-la hlam skon , him-on shoes put ; ngī atā-la nyampō-duk-khan mot-pō yot , my father-to servant many are .
The usual plural suffix is kun or gun , all , which is often abbreviated to ngun , un .
Case .
The nominative and the accusative are not distinguished by means of suffixes .
The nominative is used as the subject of intransitive verbs .
The subject of transitive verbs , on the other hand , is put in the case of the agent .
The suffix of that case is s ; thus , attā-s , by the father .
The suffix of the dative is la ; thus , atā-la , to a father ; atā-un-la , to fathers .
The dative is sometimes also used as an accusative ; thus , ngas khōi phrū-la ...tᵉangs , I have beaten his son .
The suffix la is , moreover , sometimes also used to denote the agent ; thus , attā-la khurī phrū thong , the father saw his son .
The suffix of the ablative is nā , corresponding to classical Tibetan nas .
It is commonly used to form adverbs .
It is usually combined with the genitive .
Adjectives .
Adjectives do not differ from nouns in form .
They usually precede , but sometimes also follow , the noun they qualify ; thus , mot-pō namzē , much time ; nyampō-duk-khan mot-pō , many servants .
The particle of comparison is ba ts ek ; thus , khōi phōnō khur-ri string-mō ba ts ek rgōbong thonmō-yot , his brother his sister-than more tall-is , his brother is taller than his sister .
Adjectives are often qualified by adverbs such as mā , very ; mang-mō , very much , and so forth .
Numerals .
The first numerals are given in the list of words .
They follow the word they qualify , and postpositions are accordingly added to them and not to the qualified noun ; thus , mī chik-la , man one-to .
Generic suffixes are used in two instances .
The personal pronouns which occur in the texts are as follows .
The conjugation of verbs is , broadly speaking , effected in the same way as in classical Tibetan .
The materials available are not sufficient to allow us to judge about the use of the various bases of verbs .
It is probable that the past base is commonly used in all tenses , just as is the case in Ladakhī .
The imperative is , however , often formed from a separate base .
There is apparently an incipient tendency to distinguish the person of the subject by means of suffixes added to the verb .
It is freely used in the formation of the finite tenses of other verbs .
The mere present base does not , however , occur in the materials available in other verbs than the verb substantive yot , am , art , etc.
The usual present tense of finite verbs is a compound form .
It is effected by adding suffixes to the present base .
The common suffixes are nuk , et , and at , all various forms of the copula .
Past time .
The usual base of the past tense is formed by adding s to the present base .
A past tense can also be formed by adding song or songs , went , to the infinitive .
The termination of the future tense is uk .
In other verbs the present base , with or without the addition shik , is used as an imperative .
The usual suffixes of verbal nouns are pō , bō , mō , pa , ba , and la ; thus , yot-pō , to be ; zer-bō , to say ; tᵉang-mō , to strike ; ts hō-la , to feed .
The suffix chas in gon-chas , cloth , has already been mentioned .
Compare the instances quoted under the head of relative pronouns .
The suffixes chas and khan have already been mentioned above .
Conjunctive participles are formed by adding the suffix ē to the present or past base .
The ablative suffix nā is added to the conjunctive participle ending in sē and to the participle ending in mā .
The dative suffix la is used to form an infinitive of purpose ; thus , bᵉyā-la , in order to make .
There is no passive voice .
Passivity is sufficiently indicated by the absence of the case of the agent in the subject .
The negative particle is a prefixed mā ; thus , mā-rgal-ba , did not pass ; met , no ; men , am not .
The form met is usually added to the participle in pa or ma in order to form a compound negative .
The object may precede the subject when it is followed by the suffix la .
The genitive precedes the governing word .
Adjectives and pronouns usually precede the noun they qualify , while numerals follow it .
Adverbs are put immediately before the verb , or at the beginning of the sentence .
Kamārī has hitherto been considered to be a Dravidian language , and , as such , it was classed in the Preliminary Rough List of the Languages of Raipur compiled for this Survey .
It agrees with some Aryan languages in some points , and with others in others .
The form hunā-chē , from the demonstrative pronoun hun , occurs for instance as a genitive , as a dative , and even as a nominative .
The Kamārs are stated to resemble the Gōṇḍs in appearance , and it is very probable that their original dialect was some form of Gōṇḍī .
The personal pronouns usually take the plural form ; thus , am , I .
They form their genitive by adding chō , chā , or chē ; thus , ām-chō kaṛᵃhō , my son ; tum-chō sāmᵃnē , before you ; tum-chā bhāud , your brother ; tum-chē chākᵃrī , your service .
The form āchhat , he was , is originally the third person plural of the present tense .
There are no instances of a real past tense of this verb .
The suffix dē which plays a great rôle in the conjugation of the finite verb in Halᵃbī is also frequent in Kamārī .
The true past tense is sometimes formed by adding iyā , and sometimes by adding lā ; thus , chumbiyā , he kissed ; miviyō , he was found ; jālā and jālō , he became ; bāp-nē husē dēkhiyā , dayā kēlā , the father saw him and had compassion .
In the verbal noun and the conjunctive participle we find the same mixture of dialects .
The differences between the two languages are very considerable , and a man who has a very thorough knowledge of Dulien only is quite at sea if addressed in the Rāltē language ’ .
The abrupt shortening of a vowel is indicated by adding an h , but this pronunciation seems to be rather indistinct , for we find , for instance , the same words written mu and muh , ka and kah .
The same remark holds good with regard to the vowel a^ .
There are no articles in the language .
The numeral ‘ one , ’ and indefinite pronouns are used instead of an indefinite article ; pronominal prefixes , demonstrative pronouns , or relative participles supply the place of a definite article .
Gender is only apparent in the case of animate nouns .
Names of animals are neuter when they are not distinguished by generic suffixes .
Pa denoting males , is the only generic suffix occurring in the specimens .
There are two numbers , singular and plural .
The number of the subject of a sentence is indicated by the pronominal prefix .
A short postposition may be inserted between the noun and the suffix , thus , khut-a-ke , on the hands ; but ka-thian-ke lak-a , with my friends .
The Nominative is formed without any suffix .
In may be inserted between the different parts of a compound pronoun ; thus , mi ku-in-ai-ma^ , a certain man , where ku-ai-ma^ is the pronoun .
No suffixes of the Accusative and the Dative occur in the specimen .
The Genitive is denoted by the bare stem preceding the governing word ; thus , ro ka-chan-ai , of the property my share .
There is apparently no instance of a used as a suffix of the genitive .
The interjection he is prefixed to the Vocative , thus , he pa , O father .
Adjectives follow the noun they qualify , and case suffixes are added to them , not to the qualified noun ; thus , kha^-lam la-tak-a , into a very distant country .
The suffix of the comparative degree is za^k or zok , and that of the superlative ber ; thus , nao-pang za^k , younger ; pha ber , best .
Numerals .
The numerals follow the noun .
Only the two first numerals occur .
The following are the Personal pronouns : Singular , Plural , The forms ka , na , a , and a-u , also occur as pronominal prefixes , see below .
A Reflexive pronoun is perhaps i in i-mu-leh-ka a-hi-e , mutually ( i.e., by us ) seen again he is .
The Demonstrative pronouns are hi , hi-hi , this ; chu , chu-chu , that .
There is no Relative pronoun , its place being supplied by the use of participles or verbal nouns .
Verbs are conjugated in person and number by means of pronominal prefixes .
The verb is inserted between the two parts of the plural prefixes , thus , a-pe-shi-o-v u-a , they gave not .
Compare also below , Imperative and Present participle .
The prefixes are dropped in the imperative and after nai , ai , me .
The root alone is freely used to denote the present and past tenses ; thus a hi , he is , or was .
The particle e may be added ; thus a hi-e , he is .
The suffix a is used in the same way ; thus , a ti-a , he said .
When the sentence is dependent on a subsequent clause to complete the meaning of the speaker ( compare below , Conjunctive participle ) , this a may be translated ‘ and ’ , the conjunction leh , and , being only used to connect words , not sentences .
The suffix tah in i-ha hi-tah , what is that ?
is also a suffix of the past or completed action .
A kind of Perfect is effected by adding the verb substantive ; thus , a hong-dam-leh-ka a-hi , he came alive again it is , he has indeed revived .
The suffix of the Future is ing , ing-a , thus ka tho-v-ing-a , I will arise ; ka ti-ing , I will say .
The suffix of the Imperative is a^h , oh , plural u-a ; thus , pia-a^h , give ; thei-oh , listen ; tal-u-a , kill you .
The first person plural is formed by the prefix i , and the suffix ing ; thus , i-cha ing , let us eat .
The suffix of the infinitive of purpose is ang , nang , ang-in ; thus , lim-nang , in order to rejoice ; pia-ang-in , in order to give .
There are no instances of a participle referring to the first person , to the second person singular , or the third person plural .
In the second person plural un is prefixed to lan or u is prefixed , and a suffixed .
The former method seems to be due to the influence of Standard Lushēi where n is the common plural suffix in the pronominal prefixes .
This participle is substituted for the imperative when more than one forms of the mood follow each other , the last one only remaining in the imperative .
If ma be inserted between the verb and the ending , the meaning becomes ‘ although ’ .
A Noun of agency is formed by adding the suffix tu ; thus , na shum cha-zo-vek-tu , your property ’ s waster .
There is no Passive voice ; ka-mu-leh-ka-u a-hi , he was found again , literally means ‘ we saw him again it is , ’ ‘ we certainly saw him again ’ .
Compound verbs are freely used and suffixes are then added to the last component .
Thus , Causatives are formed with tik ; thus , han-bun-tik-u-a , cause him to wear .
Desideratives are formed with nuam , to wish ; thus , a lut-nuam-mo-v-a , he to-enter-wished-not .
The verb da^n has the meaning ‘ to be about ; ’ thus ka thi-da^n-a , I am about to die .
Adjectives and numerals follow the word they qualify .
Demonstrative pronouns seem to be put at the beginning of the clause .
F.Hahn mentions that the Asurī dialect contains some Dravidian words which have possibly been borrowed from Kurukh , and also some words which he cannot identify in connected languages .
They believe in a god whom they apparently identify with Siṅboṅga , the sun , and their religion is , so far as we know , of the common Muṇḍā character .
Asurī is more closely related to the latter than to the former , though it , in many respects , agrees with Santālī .
He speaks of ‘ the check which often occurs after a vowel and especially when two vowels stand together ’ .
This remark can only refer to the semi-consonants , and I have , therefore , added them in the specimen within parenthesis .
The Jashpur specimens mark the semi-consonants , though in a very inconsistent way .
As in Muṇḍārī and Hō , the corresponding soft consonants are often substituted for them .
Mr.Hahn usually writes a long vowel instead of a final semi-consonant .
In other cases he uses the corresponding soft consonant .
Spellings such as goj and god , die ; ved-kan-ā , has come ; but vej-u ( k ’ ) - mē , come , however , point to the conclusion that the phonetical system of Asurī in this respect agrees with Santālī and Muṇḍārī , and I have therefore added the sign of the semi-consonants .
The inflexion of nouns is quite regular .
The suffixes of the dual and the plural are kin : , kū ( or kō ) , respectively .
The dative-accusative is sometimes formed by adding the Aryan suffix kē .
Usually , however , the dative and the accusative are indicated in the verb .
The first numerals are 1 , mīat ’ ; 2 , bariā ; 3 , pēā ; 4 , upuniā ; 5 , moyā~ ; 6 , turiā ; 7 , aiyā ; 8 , irliyā ; 9 , areā ; 10 , geleā .
For five , etc., however , the Hindī numerals are commonly used .
The personal pronouns are regular .
There is a verb īdan-ā , ( he ) is , which is often used as an impersonal verb ; thus , īdan-me-ā , thou art.
Note the prefixing of ov ( i.e.
w ) before suffixes beginning with a vowel ; thus , hāṭiṅ-ovat ’ - kiṅ-ā , divided to them two .
The future does not take any suffix .
It can however be doubted whether this gē is not the ordinary intensifying particle gē .
In other respects Asurī seems to agree very closely with Muṇḍārī and Santālī .
